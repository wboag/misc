I brought my girlfriend for a short one night stay this past weekend. I had booked the room online months before for several hundred dollars. At check-in, I was informed that I had been \"upgraded\" to a different room. However, upon arriving at our \"upgraded\" casita room, I was shocked by how incredibly small it was - and I was flabbergasted by our \"upgraded\" view - literally directly into a parking lot. They must have been kidding.\nI wondered to myself if perhaps the hotel was at max capacity, so I went online to look. Much to my dismay, I learned that they had many, MANY rooms available for that evening - and that they were going at a rate 75% cheaper than what I had paid. So what gives? As a Starwood Preferred Guest as well as a return customer, and a guest paying well over market price, I would hope (and expect) that I would be given a better room that doesn't look out into a parking garage, especially when they had so many available. But no.\nI requested to be moved to a new room in the main hotel with a better view, and the front desk sent over a bellman with the new keys. After a long trek to the new room, which was NOT in fact in the main hotel, and which was actually facing rocks rather than the panoramic view of the pool and mountains, we learned that the door was completely locked from the inside --- the deadbolt had somehow locked itself. What a joke. I then went to a house phone and called the front desk, expecting that they would simply put us into a new room - one with a working door. The person who picked up was not particularly friendly or apologetic, but said that she would send Security up to try to get the lock open. After 15 minutes passed where we stood awkwardly in the hallway with all of our luggage and nobody came, I called again and requested to speak to the manager. They said that the manager was busy, and that Security would be coming. Eventually, Security did come and let us into the room, but by this point we were furious. It took us well over an hour to get settled into our room, and we never did receive a call from the manager or front desk apologizing for the immense inconvenience. That is not how you treat your paying, repeat customers.\nLastly, the television in our room wasn't functioning properly, as the sound kept cutting in and out. For a 5 star Luxury hotel, I expect all of the in-room amenities to be working.\nThe Phoenician used to be my favorite hotel, but after this experience with incredibly poor customer service, I won't return again, nor will I recommend it to my friends or colleagues. Such a disappointment.","useful":11,"funny":0,"cool":0}

What USED to be my favorite restaurant has gone down-hill in food quality to the point where I don't ever want to go back. For 8 years, whenever someone asks me what my favorite restaurant was, it was always Lure Bistro! Looking forward to going back for dinner on Friday night I was excited to tell my friend how much he would enjoy it. However, for everything we ordered, all we could talk about was how disappointed we were at the lack of flavor and culinary execution. The calamari had WAY too much oil! The breading literally dripped off of the overcooked meat because it was SATURATED in oil. As mentioned, the meat was overcooked, reminding us of chewing on hard rubber bands. On top of that the flavor left a LOT to be desired. There was a slight hint of...peppers and bacon? Hard to tell because it was barely a hint and we ended up having to salt the pieces to attempt to get them down. It was, literally, the WORST calamari I've EVER had. For the record, we order calamari at every restaurant we eat that offers it, and this is by far the worst we've ever had. The spicy tuna roll was TINY, at best, and not nearly displaying the fullness of the pieces I've ordered previously at Lure Bistro (that's my go-to and I order it every time regardless of what else I get there) .The pieces were not only tiny, but inconsistent and sloppily prepared, and lacked...love? The oysters tasted like they were fresh water...completely void of flavor. Even by drenching them in lemon juice, horse radish, and the super bland cocktail sauce did not help. By the way, was that cocktail sauce even 'spiced-up' what-so-ever? It tasted like it came straight from the store and I guarantee you the label probably said \"plain & unflavored\".  The ribs were good, but too dry, but at least the meat fell off the bone and was cooked well. The fries were globs of greasy potato that could not even be improved adding a full layer of visible salt on each. \n\nThe last thing that annoyed me was getting the \"hold-on-a-second\" finger from the bartender when we called over to him for something. A polite \"one moment\" would have been better...not the finger you give someone who is your employee or child. It's rude when you do that to customers at your restaurant. But that was the least of my concerns. \n\nI'm SO disappointed because I used to LOVE this place! The only reason this got 2 stars is because I have memories of when it was once actually good! If this was my first time there it would have definitely only received one.\n\nWhat happened, Lure Bistro? Change of management? New cooks? For the record, it's been a little less than a year since I was there last, and it was still good at that time. Maybe a different cook that night?\n\nI'm so disappointed that I will not be able to brag about this place like I used to. I hope that management reads this and somehow promotes that changes have been made and I will possibly attempt to try it again in the future, but if not, then I'll just assume that lovely nights at Lure Bistro are a thing of the past.\n\nHopefully this was a fluke and if you go you don't have the same experience with the dreadful quality of food that I did Friday night.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I have normally not had any issues until today. I seen Tong or Thang I believe is her name. Tiny younger asian woman. She did my nails for the first time coffin. I have always gotten square shaped nails because that is the shape I've always gotten and am used to. However, I wanted to try something new. I got the coffin nails and then the next day I decided they weren't for me. I then came back and Tong was not there so another lady cut and filed them to make them more square. She had told me Tong can fix them more if I want to come back tomorrow which would be the 3rd time I came back. So today I come in and nobody's in the salon except one customer. The two ladies were sitting in pedicure chairs on their phones and Tong was the only one working. They told me to wait a little and she will do mine. I waited a few minutes then she calls me over after finishing the lady she was working on. I told her they were super sharp and I could poke my eye out. I mean, they were extremely sharp! I told her I'd like them square again. She started to argue and tell me I have to do round and that's not what I want. I've never done round and I don't like that. I asked for square. I've had square many times that weren't sharp like that. She said because I went from coffin to square they are sharp. But I know that you can file them down to be less sharp and use the buffer or drill. She asked me what I want her to do? I said I would like square nails that are filed down. I mean she's the nail tech and should know! She just continued to be super rude and argue with me. I told her this shouldn't be a big deal. I'm a regular too and come in every 2 weeks and this was completely unacceptable. \n\nI also had told her I realized you charged me more for coffin nails which I didn't even know costed more because I've never gotten them. This was my FIRST time and she knew it because I've been going to her consistently usually every 2 weeks. She blamed me saying I didn't ask the price. I didn't know I had to ask because i didn't think it would be more. A good salon will at least say \"hey, this is gonna cost $5 more\". She failed to let me know this. All she told me the day I got them was its $70. She didn't mention they costed more so I figured it was for my pedi and design. So anyways, after filing my nails they were STILL too sharp! I just ended up leaving because of how unprofessional and rude she was! I do not recommend this place anymore. This used to be my favorite place but this lady ruined it for me. Being rude in front of another customer to me and blaming me for her not informing me of stuff and not even fixing my nails. I ended up going to another salon who buffed them and now they're no longer sharp. She just didn't care or put effort into it. Also, the ladies in the salon sitting in the pedi chair were giving me dirty looks and talking in Vietnamese (probably about me). Don't waste your time or money!

Extremely long line getting in the door, not the friendliest of staff, waaaaay oversold and overpriced beers.\n\nSuch an amazing act on stage, Oteil and friends, literally an allstar band of funk\/blues\/rock.  Regrettably I spent over 30 minutes in line waiting for the show because they only had 1 door open.  Once I got inside I came to realize there was literally no where for me to see the show.  WTF?  The entire main concert area was packed to the gills, no getting through.  The side bar area was packed as well.  Plus, over there, everyone was talking and you couldn't hear the band well.  I then spent 30 minutes waiting to pay $8 for a beer.  The last time I went to The Underground over by the Fillmore I was thinking, why isn't this show at the Neighborhood Theatre.  Now I am kind of ambivalent on the matter.\n\nI'll be back if they pull the right bands, but I certainly don't call this place home anymore and won't be recommending it to out of towners.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

The smoked salmon is only served occasionally as an appetizer.  It's absolutely delicious, and we ask if it's available every time we go.\n* My husband has even several of their specials, including the crispy duck and BBQ platter.  \n* Their white chocolate bread pudding is topped with carmelized pecans, and is just divine.\n\nThe not as good -\n* The main dining room is very dark.  Hence, we prefer dining in the bar or outside.\n* In general, we're not impressed with their entrees.  Several of our entree favorites from the menu have been removed, like the shrimp pasta, scallops with cheddar grits (a Saturday staple), and fish tacos.  Items that are off our list are the salmon (too sweet), trout (a bit bland), and the lobster roll (too much filler and too greasy).  \n* Avoid the ranch dressing at all costs.  It's sweet and just plain awful.\n* Most of their martinis and specialty drinks are well-sized and amply filled.  The pear martini used to be my favorite, HOWEVER, during my last visit, it was so ridiculously sweet, I couldn't drink it.

Also, the bathrooms are never clean and the bartender often stops for a cigarette, I like low tar with my beer but that is just me. Anyway, this establishment used to be my favorite but until the consistency returns and Mama Celeste is always in the kitchen then this place will be a miss. I gave this 2 stars for old times sake.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We tasted them and, blech! They tasted like they came from those Tastee-freeze machines at a state fair, or something. When my husband complained to the waitress, she simply told him that if he wanted a strong drink he \"should order the frozen ones.\"\nRight...\nSeriously, the rude waitress thing was something new, too. Usually people there have been really friendly.\nThen I had the same wild mushroom enchiladas I've always had. I was dismayed to find that the enchiladas now include squash and carrots and other veggies inside. It really ruins the flavor.

Sacha has been working at this location for a while too, and he's cool, but I dealt with Dijon a lot more and he knew me as a regular and always hooked up free shwag.\nIf you're used to buying videogames, then you may know how a store like this works, however, some people are still noobs, so I'm here to help.  \nLet me start with a list of things to do and things not to do at this franchise.\n\nDO:\nNumber 1 - Pre-orders:\nPre-order the AAA titles that have collector's editions or special editions, or limited produced items like arcade fightsticks.  Wal-mart and best buy usually won't have these items and gamestop will only order as many as they are reserved, so if you don't, you're fucked, and you're going to be hitting up ebay and paying double or triple the retail value in some cases.\nPre-order the hot titles and if you change your mind come release day, just back out and get your money back. You don't HAVE to buy the game if you change your mind, and nobody is forcing you to.  It's just like having a little bit of security and not getting screwed when the game gets sold out elsewhere.  As incentive,  there's always exclusive pre-order bonuses for in-game content, and they call to remind you when the game will be out a couple days before...so why not.\n\nNumber 2 - \"Free Rentals\":\nSome people might not be aware of this loop-hole, but if you buy a USED game, you have 7 days to return it for a full refund, granted you kept the receipt.  This is mostly for the Achievement and Trophy whores who know that they'll beat a certain game in a week and want nothing to do with it again after that...whores like me.  This is also convenient if you're considering buying a game, but are not sure if you'll like it, or if you think you might get bored of it after a while.  I use the term \"free\" loosely, because you do have to front the money, but you get it back in the end.  \nTry it out at least once.\n\nDON'T:\nNumber 1 - Trade Ins:\nI've heard it a million times, pissed off gamers who think Gamestop is so evil because they give you pennies on the dollar for your used games, then turn around and sell it at retail price.  This is true...they do that.  But if they're going to sell a game at retail, why shouldn't you get retail price for it?  \nFor this, I suggest ebay for getting the right amount of cash back for your games you don't want anymore.  Here, you can undersell Gamestop, but still get back more what they would offer you.  Play the money game; instead of giving them nothing but profit by buying their used games, use the \"free rentals\" loop-hole.  Instead of getting ripped off by them on trade-ins, undersell them on ebay. \n\nNumber 2 - Midnight Releases:\nI would highly advise to never go to a midnight release...at any location. For reals...they're always shitty and you'll have a fucked up time because it's just not that much of an organized event if you're strictly going there with intent to buy the game at midnight.  It's chaotic.  D-bags cut in line in front of those who have been waiting hours, the kids are annoying, and there is no structure at the registers.\nI mean, I guess if you plan on not getting home until 1 - 2am, downing RedBull, and staying up all night with your new game, then go for it.\nI, however, prefer to save the headache, go to bed instead, and come back in the morning where the game will be waiting.   I'm too old for that midnight shit anyway.  It's just not cool to me.\n\nAll in all, Gamestop is the juggernaut of commercial game sales, and their stores are popping up more than McDonald's and Starbucks, which is a good thing.\nI've spent more money on new games than I can remember at these stores because I'm an avid collector, and they cater to my needs.  Occasionally, I'll buy used if it's a game I never picked up on launch day, and it's been marked down decently and it's in pristine shape, and if I think I'll keep it for more than a week, haha.\n\nGamestop is legit.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":1}

Came with my parents to foot the bill haha. I have had all the nice buffets: Bellagio, Wynn, Wicked Spoon, and other lesser ones like the Mirage and Rio. Bellagio used to be my favorite but I think Bacchanal has surpassed it. Each buffet has its signature qualities like the Wynn is known for desserts, Bellagio for seafood. Bacchanal had an amazing gourmet selection of all kinds of foods, everything was meticulously prepared and presented. \n\nPros:\nSeafood was fresh, esp the oysters and the king crab legs. Ceviche could use some work though.\nThe Mexican drinks at the Mexican bar!\nThe LAMB LEG was SO GOODD\nChocolate filled Beignets (I took the last one and it was like 9pm...) \nGelato selection! Even mochi ice cream!\nLava cake was actually lava. But they don't serve it in ramekins anymore...\nBrussels sprouts!\nVeggie cup\nCold cut selection!\n\nCons:\nEverything beef. The prime rib was dry and unjuicy. The wagyu beef burger was blech, with a terrible dried bun. The meatball was cold and blah. \n\nIt is expensive, but the selection and quality of the food makes up for it compared to the other buffets.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1}

They totally changed up the menu and specials and remodeled.  The new look of the dining room is pretty cool and much more open and they have a shuffle board table which is cool.  The patio is still pretty cool when the TVs are operational.  Service overall seems to have gotten better since they have reopened.  I am not a fan of the new menu at all.  They have changed the recipe of their hot wing sauce and I am not too found of them (they used to be my favorite wings in town).  I have had the pizza a couple times and it is absolutely awful, even for the 5 dollar special they have most evenings and weekends.  The crust is a good crispy thin crust, but the sauce has all of the flavor of maybe ketchup at best and there is barely enough cheese to cover the thing.  There are also now a handful of overpriced Chicago type of items on the menu like Chicago dogs, polish sausages, Italian sausage\/beef, but there are so many other Chicago style restaurants in the area with better prices I find it hard to try any of them.  I have tried their cheese filled toasted ravioli which were cool on happy hour, but I think they have since removed those from the menu.  As far as drinks go if it is happy hour the $3 wells are the way to go.  Draft beers are I think $4 for HH and $5 regular which is strip club\/night club pricey to me for a regular pint.  Wells are almost $5 when it is not happy hour as well, so I would suggest getting a long island for $5 which is huge and also good.  Overall even though I still frequent this place, I just cannot enjoy myself here like I used to and find myself going to Zipps more and more.  They have also kicked smokers off of half of the back half of the patio, I guess so they can open those doors on nice days.  This used to be a place where you could enjoy a nice cigar, a drink and watch the game.  Since they have moved the smoking area, you really cannot enjoy yourself the same way.  The space is more limited over on that side and the TVs are much smaller.  Not to mention only one of the two TVs over there works.  I would also think this change would bother non smokers too since the smoking area is now right next to the front door making all the customers walk past the smell.  Such a shame what happened here really.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I ordered the 3 course combo: side house salad, Max's cheeseburger & seasoned fries, Erma's chocolate chip cookie. The salad was inoffensive, the burger much smaller than the bun was boring, the cookie -whatever.  If I come back it'll be for drinks and snacks not a burger. Maybe I'll go down the street to Five Guys for that.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

When I first moved to Bethel Park and found out that there was a Luciano's in town (I had been to the one on Rt. 48 several times) I was extremely happy, because friends out on that side of town know it's the best pizza around.  When I looked at YELP and saw that somebody gave the Bethel Park Luciano's a ONE STAR RATING in a review, I had to laugh, because that jerk probably enjoys the cardboard garbage they serve down at Danny's!  Nothing like that \"vendetta review\" when somebody makes you angry, huh?  THE FACT IS that Luciano's has outstanding food.  Their pizza is first-rate, and so are their calzones.  (although what they call a calzone is actually a stromboli, technically.  You have to ASK for ricotta cheese...)  They have family dine-in specials like all-you-can-eat pasta, and the prices are very modest, while the quality of the food is great.  The hoagies are superb.  You can get a good beer on tap, or in a bottle, and you can get it delivered to your doorstep.  Luciano's is everything that a local pizza place should be, and it's even better because they have a nice little dining room with table service.  I have probably spent more money at Luciano's than I have at any other pizza place in my considerably long life of eating pizza, and only a couple of times have I ever been disappointed, mostly because the place was SLAMMED with lots of loyal customers and my food took a lot longer than usual as a result.  If I call in an order, I always ask the phone person to repeat my order to me, because Luciano's is a local joint, a low-budget place, and they hire the local kids.  It's AWESOME that they are hiring our local kids, the kids need money and they need to learn what it's like to work.  BUT, once in a while, a kid screws up.  They're kids, and they make mistakes, especially if they are new.  BUT, despite the fact that the faces working behind the counter are sometimes quite young, I've NEVER been disappointed in the food.  The only reason that Luciano's is #2 on my South Hills pizza preference right now is because somebody a couple of miles further away is surpassing them in quality right now.  I still call Luciano's, and their food is still in the 99th percentile, and this is not based on a small sample size or a single experience!  Pay no attention to  hotheads.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The rice was cooked well, it wasn't gummy or hard. It was seasoned just right. The fish was fresh, lacking in any odor as far as I can tell, and were delicious. However, the size of the sushi pieces themselves were so tiny. About half the size of what you would get at other sushi restaurant but double the price. It was a size of sushi you would expect you local cheap Chinese buffet, but with better rice and better seafood.  I wouldn't mind the price so much if I actually got a full size piece. It's looks like a cost cutting measure to me, since red sushi moved from its more hole in the wall type of atmosphere to its current hip-looking establishment on the other side of the square. Which brings to me my biggest complaint about this place.\n\nIt's just so... douchey now. Between the decor, the perfumed air, the club music, and the lit up bar, I wasn't sure my drink would be actually liquid or some weird gatro-drink ala Parks and Rec.

I've been going to the carnival world buffet since 2003. In 2003, they left me with an unforgettable experience and the food was really yummy. I went back to the buffet in 2008 and it was by far still really good food. Then doing the recession they offered Locals 50 percent off and it used to be a really great value. I would go once a week since it was only 12.99 for dinner. However, I noticed in 2012, they started cutting back on the desserts, the food quality starting becoming tasteless and cold, and the price went up. Recently, this year its no longer 50 percent for a local if you have a gold total rewards card. It's only a 25 percent discount and its now 35 dollars for 2 adult locals for lunch. It's way overpriced for cold, low endless food. The pastries are barely there and mainly just a few fruit pies and gelato. This used to be my favorite buffet but now I will never go back after the experience I have had this year with the food tasting bad. i noticed different managers were working there now than the managers in 2012. If they bring back the carnival world buffet like it were in 2008, then I would go once a week and pay the extra fee, but to me its not worth it. The chefs do not care about the way the food is cooked and I think the food is just being reheated and nothing is cooked homemade. They produce cheap low end ingredients and make you pay for a high priced buffet.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I'm not sure if that was a special event, or something they do every weekend.  The atmosphere is very nice, but the benches on many of the booths are so high that you feel more like you are waiting for the bus, than hanging out smoking hookah.

We were in there 2+ hours and there was only one other booth occupied the entire time so I'm not sure what they were waiting for.  The tea selection is great, but I feel like they've changed the recipes a bit.

My girlfriends and I had an annual Vegas vacation and stayed here a few times, always leaving with smiles and great memories....not this time. My hubby didn't want to stay here to begin with and now we won't be back (one of my girlfriends also came with us and also had a poor experience). \n\nHighlights: LOVE by Cirque du Soleil, Private Reserve Pool (sort of), security staff and housekeeping friendliness\n\nOpportunities: Check-in, rooms, restaurant options, casino, cleanliness\n\nI had reserved a Mirage Suite a few months ago, checked in online the day before arriving and still had a terrible check-in experience. We planned to arrive after check-in time so we could go directly to our rooms. My friend got her email that her room was ready before we even got to the hotel. The check-in line was way too long so I was glad to have done online check-in but didn't have my email so went to mobile check-in desk. The guy at the desk didn't have a great attitude and proceeded to tell me that they only had accessible suites left and it would be ready within an hour. I told him that I didn't reserve or want an accessible room but he gave me no options and said I would receive an email within an hour. We went and waited for the email in The Still. 1.3 hours later I still had no email and went back to the desk where there was now a woman. I told her how displeased I was and asked about my room (I was not rude or loud or bitchy). She found a regular Mirage Suite that was immediately available and said she put a $50 beverage credit on my account. \n\nUpon entering room it was warm and dark. We turned down the temp but it took about two days to cool off to a comfortable point. I couldn't tell if the bathrooms were clean. Meaning, I didn't see obvious signs of uncleanliness, but it didn't feel clean. We did like that there was a fridge in the suite for us to keep food or drinks we purchased elsewhere and The separate sitting area is nice. The shower could be larger and the furniture could be in better shape. We did love the complimentary slippers.\n\nMy friend was in a regular room. She found hair in her bathtub when she was going to take a bath the first night. She also said it didn't feel super clean. She didn't have complimentary slippers.\n\nRoom Service is much more limited than it was last time we were here. A very limited portion of the Pantry menu is available. Some other restaurants offer takeout but you have to go down to order and take it. The restaurant options are very limited and pretty disappointing. Go take a look at my reviews of Stack, The Pantry, The Still, LVB and Carnegie Deli. The nicer restaurants are hidden away and not really advertiseso didn't entice us to try them.\n\nThe pool wasn't as clean as it used to be. But I still prefer the Private Reserve for the comfy chairs and umbrellas, along with random fruit and essence water. Waitress was friendly but was surprised that \"last call\" was just after 3. \n\nCasino was VERY DIRTY! The video machines were covered in ashes and sticky stuff. The chairs were burned up. The ceiling looked gross. It was super dark in there, probably so you couldn't see all the dirt and dinginess. I would suggest putting rolls of paper towels and windex around for guests to clean their machines. Several times I just gave up on the casino bc it grossed me out. \n\nOverall this is not what it used to be. We will be selecting a different resort when we return.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I'm not saying the food is that great, it was more because of the personable and accommodating bar staff, great ambience, diversity of clientele, and live music on Friday and Saturday nights. However, on a recent visit, my husband and I experienced a rather unusual and disturbing encounter with Jason the General Manager that I won't soon forget. Call it corporate political-correctness run amok, but the way Jason tried to represent his other patrons at the expense of alienating two of his best was inexcusable. Jason was not rude, but let's just say he was a bit...snarky? smug? condescending? Jason came up to us from behind the bar and interrupted our conversation to explain that we were this night, or in the past, a bit too brash. I don't remember his exact words, but this was the gist. This is a bar, after all, and I thought it was typical for people to have loud and lively debates, but I digress. As I challenged him because he clearly did not have his facts straight, he refused to be specific, only saying that \"other people\" concurred. Humbly, I admit that my husband and I can get a little heated in our conversations, WITH EACH OTHER, and if Jason could have identified what either of us said that was rude or offensive, perhaps I would understand. During this berating session, I just looked at him completely bewildered because we had been there less than 30 minutes. Whatever his goal, Jason handled the situation very poorly. Would it not have been better for us to talk directly to the people we offended, if indeed we offended them?\n\nIncidentally, since it's opening, we were in the habit of spending over $300 a week at this Fox restaurant alone.

Over the past 4 years, I've seen a decline in the quality of service and a steep incline in prices. After my last visit, I will not be coming here anymore. The actual quality of the regular manicure and pedicure were not bad. My concern is seeing another nail technician clipping his own nails with the tools he uses on customers in the salon. I watched him clip his nails with his clippings flying everywhere and he, nor did any of the other staff bothered to do\/say anything.\n\nI have deep concerns regarding the cleanliness of this business. After my pedicure, my feet began to itch. Something that has never happened before. Two toes on my right foot have become swollen and intensely itchy. I can only attribute this issue to the pedicure in what I can assume was a poorly disinfected basin with tools reused on staff and other customers. \n\nI will never come to this salon again.

But my experience last night was less what I was hoping for.\n\nFirst, the price. It's gone UP! And I didn't notice a significant change to accompany this increase. If I remember correctly, The Buffet used to be priced around $30-35 a few years ago. Last night (Friday night) we were charged $49.99 per adult, and $24.99 per child (3 years and up). WOW... Bachannal really made the influence on the rest of The Strip with their pricing I guess!\n\nSecond, the first impression. It was fine... But a few things. They wanted to dump us off on a table very far from the action. We asked to be seated closer to the food were told that it could take \"a while,\" so we sat. Turns out \"a while\" was just two minutes. When we were seated, our hostess said, \"please enjoy your two hour dinning experience!\" Wow... that seemed pretty tacky. I've never heard of a time limit at any of the Vegas buffets and it just seemed a little passive aggressive. Seems like a sign at the register or quick mention before being seated would have been less tacky.\n\nOkay... the food. GOOD FOOD. As usual, there's lots of fillers and range from bleh to great, so I won't go into those. It's the main items I was interested in: meat and seafood. The prime rib was cooked medium-well to well... above my taste preference. But since it was nice and tender, and I drizzled some au-jus, it was good. (Quick note, you can have them sear the prime rib on the grill if you like it that way!) They had a fancy ribeye that was the opposite, it was rare... so a under what I prefer. (I'm not the only one that thinks medium-rare is the perfect way to enjoy steak, right?) It was good though... great flavor! Then came the BBQ beef rib... and let me tell you, I love my BBQ beef ribs. If you've been to Lucille's and had their BBQ beef ribs, that's what I was hoping for. But no, a resounding no. This thing was dry rubbed with sauce on the side, which is fine... but it was DRY DRY DRY. Felt like it had been under the heat lamps since lunch. I sadly could only eat two bites of that. I didn't bother with the roasted turkey but since I'm a sucker for fried chicken, I had to try a piece and it was good, tender juicy inside and good crispy batter on the outside. As for the seafood, cocktail shrimp is hard to mess up... that was amazing as usual. And crab legs were great! I ate WAAAY too many crab legs dipped in drawn butter. Not a big sushi eater, but it looked good. The sides are all hit and miss, usually because of taste preference. The shrimp hargow was gross, sadly... but there was a crispy fried flat shrimp eggroll that was good. Mashed potatoes, corn... soups, etc.\n\nDessert. You could come just for the dessert and it would almost be worth it (at their previously lower prices!). Creme brulee was awesome as usual. Then I chose to get a crepe, fill it with apple filling, cream, vanilla bean ice cream, and then topped with vanilla and chocolate sauces... I was completely full, but had to keep eating because of this.\n\nOverall, I was hoping for a bit more... Maybe it was the extra traffic on the I-15 from LA making me hungrier... but I have fonder memories of The Buffet. I think for now, I'm going to say the Bellagio Buffet would probably be a better value.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The lady in the kitchen was very unhappy and rude that she had to remake the dish but instead of throwing my original food away she took it back and set it on the kitchen line. Now being that I was a server and bartender for over 10 years, I know this is not the typical practice nor sanitary so I watched what became of the food. She kept looking over at me and finally took the food into the back somewhere. She brought it back moments later and they handed it to me to take home. I opened it right there in front of them and it looked so soupy. I did not see any new dish being made so I can only believe that she added water and god knows what else to the original Panang curry.

I went there last evening though and this was definitely my final trip there.  Just awful experience.  My party was seated within 5 minutes - so far so good.  Our server was pleasant and tried to be attentive.  However, she was spread across at least twice as many tables as a single server can reasonably cover, so her ability to check in with us was hampered.  I don't fault her for any of the adverse experience though.  The management there should be completely scrapped.  it took an hour for our food to arrive and each person in my party had a very simple meal that should have taken at most 10 minutes to make.  The server confirmed that they had only 1 cook working and he was covering the entire restaurant.  The establishment was filled at every table, so obviously this was horrible planning on the management's part.  When the food finally arrived, it was not what I had come to expect.  I and one of my party ordered our old favorite - the fish and chips.  The price had come up about $3\/plate on this meal, but hey, whatever.  However, when it was delivered we had half of the fish pieces over before and less than 1\/4 of the fries.  The coleslaw was horrible, too - and that used to be my favorite part.  The portions used to be too big but this was an insane swing in the opposite direction to couple with a significant price hike.  $16.99 for a kid-sized meal from McDonalds.  The fish was also undercooked.  The 3rd member of my party ordered a chicken club.  It came out with this 1\/4 inch thick triangle of chicken jerky that he literally had to take the bun off in order to find.  The bun was 2 inches thick in total.  Suffice it to say he got bread with a hint of chicken flavoring.  Because of how horribly inefficient the service was, at this point we have 15 minutes until our hockey game started.  We alerted the server to our concerns when going to pay the bill.  She immediately engaged the manager, but after 10 minutes we had to flag her down to find out what was going on - we still hadn't received a receipt to sign.  She server informed us that the manager decided not to charge us but should have been by.  He never appeared.  Upon departing we found him hanging out on the back patio bar area, chatting and laughing with people that were obviously his friends.

I cannot tell you how many people I took to Sens. I literally believe it was in the 100s. I tried to start every night there when I was living downtown and most nights ended there. \n\nThen I moved to Midtown and had a regular bird and we would do date night there but it just wasn't the same in terms of frequency. \n\nThen came ASU and downtown changed and they fucked up his street and he'd had his eye on the new spot that is now Sochu House for a while and the stars aligned and he moved. And I moved back downtown literally a mile from Sochu House. \n\nDallas G - The Hot and Dirty Life, Redux, or so I thought. I was so hopeful. \n\nAnd so I started going there at least once a weekend and it felt like old times with some of the old bartenders and the ever clever and interesting Johnny... \n\nBut, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, people started being honest with me. The problem is that I'm a vegan and I don't eat anything that comes from an animal. Like, if I know an animal molecule is in my food, I won't eat it. \n\nAnd I found out there's fish sauce in the Papaya salad, which was one of my favorite things on Earth. And there's fish sauce in some of the sauces. So what used to be my favorite place on Earth became a source of stress and distrust. \n\nSo I had to stop eating there. But I still go for the drinks. Just not like I used to... \n\nThe food here, in my opinion, is so good. So so good. If you're don't care what died to feed you, I highly recommend this place.

We picked this place because we always used to come here for our Szechuan food fix. When we got there, there were only two other tables of customers, even though it was only 12:30pm.\n\nWe started off with two plates of their cold dishes, which always used to be my favorite. If you're a fan of cold spicy dishes, I recommend the 夫妻肺片 (basically Chinese cold cuts). As a family, we also ordered the 水煮魚片 (Boiled Fish Sliced in Hot Sauce), 辣子雞 (Chicken with Chilies), 清炒空心菜 (One Choy Garlic in White Sauce), 孜然羊肉 (Cumin Lamb), and 蒜泥白肉 (Sliced Pork with Spicy Garlic Sauce). Flavor-wise, everything was good, but the spice level was not there at all. I'm the weak one in the family - usually I'm sweaty and snotty and on the verge of tears when the rest of my family is just eating away. While the food here was flavorful, it was definitely not spicy. Of the dishes we ordered, I would probably recommend the Cumin Lamb, just because that was the most authentic one in my opinion.\n\nService was mediocre at best. The food took a while to come out even though we were the only table that had ordered food at that point (the other tables were already almost done eating by the time we ordered). They also forgot our Sliced Pork with Spicy Garlic Sauce. So, although that's a cold dish, it came out last. They were also playing some sort of religious program really loudly on the TV, which was a little distracting.\n\nAt the end of our meal, they asked us if we'd be willing to pay cash instead of credit, which I was fine with. I think we got a little bit of a discount for that but unfortunately I don't remember how much. Anyway, I'm a little disappointed all in all. This was not a very satisfying meal for me or for my family.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1}

My friend ordered a side salad ribs n spinach. I just got an appetizer. She never came back until the food showed and brought my friend the salad with her entree.

I ordered my favorites: Hamachi, Spanish Mackerel, Salmon, Maguro, Uni, Scallop, and a Sushi Guro roll. The waiter returned and informed me that they were out of Uni, so I added Toro to the mix. When my plate arrived, as usual, I went straight for a piece of Hamachi. It was perfectly fresh. Next, I directed my chopsticks for a piece of Toro and realized it was very pale in color (something I've never seen in the 28 years that I have been enjoying Sushi and Sashimi). I popped the piece in my mouth and tasted something else. No, it wasn't a beautifully marbled piece of Maguro. It was more like another piece of Yellowtail (Hamachi). It didn't seem right so I placed a piece of Hamachi and a piece of the so called Toro that was served to me side by side, and low and behold, they were identical, but sliced in a different way so as the color pattern on the fish were not in the same places. When the server stopped by our table to check in to see how our food was, I informed him about (what I thought was a mix up), showed him the two \"different\" pieces of fish, he agreed with me and apologized for the sushi chef's mistake. I said I was disappointed, that it was ok, but that I wasn't going to pay the price for Toro when it actually was Hamachi. The server said he completely understood. Moments later, the lead sushi chef\/co-owner, Cy, came over to our table in a huff and questioned what the problem was. I explained the issue and showed him the fish comparison. He VERY RUDELY said what he served to me was indeed Toro but Hamachi Toro. I stood my ground (in a nice way) and refused to accept his BS. Please, if there was such a thing, I would have had it before. I moved to Charlotte from the NYC Metropolitan area less than 2 years ago. I've had sashimi at some of the best Japanese Sushi\/Sashimi establishments in the US and have NEVER been offered Hamachi Toro, nor have I ever seen it available on any menu before. I even went as far as googling Toro and read nothing about Hamachi, everything revolved around Magoru when it came to Toro. After Cy stomped away from our table in a bigger huff, the lovely wait person came by and actually apologized for the way our party was treated by one of the owners. We finished our plates and our drinks, paid the bill ($150+ for 2 people, each having 1 Saporo, without Toro and without tip), left a generous tip, and walked out of Sushi Guru for the last time.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I've spent  a LOT of money here, well over a grand. Bought a skeleton key, IPV4, numerous RDA's, tons of juice, and my last purchase a 200$ Petri Mod. Where they lost me as a customer is when my brand new mod has a non-functioning button. I bring it back in two days later with the firing button jammed and the guy behind the counter just kinda stares at it and says it must be my fault and they can't do anything about it. I explain that it's not my fault (and it wasn't) the mod is cherry. Not a scratch, ding or nick. Still though, no help. They won't  replace it, they won't handle contacting the manufacturer, nothing. Caveat Emptor is apparently the name of the game, even if they sell defective merchandise. \n\nNow you might be thinking, oh hey, this guy must have dropped his mod and wanted a freebie. Well, I got in touch with James over at dot mods. Small world, turns out we went to the same high school back in SD. I ended up being out there for my girls graduation and got to meet up with him and see the factory. Great guy, and proper customer service. He figured out the issue (manufacturer defect, no worries, it happens) and swapped out my button for a working one. Which really, is all I would have needed to be kept as a happy customer. \n\nI guess my point is that as a B&M vape shop, they only thing you offer over online stores is customer service. With an online shop I can get better selections and better prices. What is the point of paying higher prices, driving half way across town, and still getting told to kick rocks when getting sold a defective product. When I have to LITERALLY drive six hours away to deal with the manufacturer because you can't be bothered.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2}

I've been coming to the MGM Grand since I was a kid since it was my family's go-to hotel. \n\nUnfortunately, after my latest trip out to Paradise, I'm sad to say that the MGM will no longer be my first choice. I recently convinced a friend to pick a suite at the MGM for his birthday. The suite was cool, though a bit dated compared to it's counterparts elsewhere, but it was a great deal for so much space. Everything went well until I was on my way back home. I realized that I'd left a swimsuit behind in the hotel - I'd left it to dry and was about to pack it in before getting sidetracked - so I called the hotel up letting them know. What I did not expect was them to say that the housekeepers had not turned anything in from the room.. Mind you, this was maybe 1 hour after we'd left and I'd distinctly pinpointed it before leaving so there was no way it could've \"fallen in the trash\" or been left somewhere else. It was hooked onto the faucet so it could only be removed deliberately and it was impossible to miss (bright orange). Now it's only $40 so I didn't bother filing a complaint, but it's the principle of the matter. If you can't trust hotel staff to keep their hands off a $40 swimsuit, can you trust them with anything else? That's my main problem. A friend once left an iPad at the Venetian and a called was placed to HIM as soon as it was found. Speaks volumes when hotel staff might feel the need to steal something as petty as a $40 swimsuit. \n\nI've already had to advise my coworkers to move an upcoming event in Vegas to another hotel after this experience, and I'm sorry to have to let the MGM go. It's heartbreaking to see a once great hotel get overshadowed by all the newcomers, but there's a reason this is so. Still, thanks for all the memories MGM!","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I've dine here several times and its slowly becoming my favorite steakhouse in all of Arizona.  The customer service always shines though and the food and ambiance is amazing.  So here's an updated review, everything was on point from the great customer service to the awesome food that we ordered.\n\nSo my wife and I made a reservation on Saturday Night at 6:30.  We arrived and were seated promptly.  The location of the tables wasn't the greatest, cause there are a lot of waiters running by and the bar was on the other side, which made it a little noisy.  Other than that, everything was fantastic.  Our server was Kevin, the guy was attentive and on it.  It seems they work as a team, cause every time my lemonade or water reached half full, they were on top of it!  Soon when we finished our dishes, they cleared it with the quickness.  Impressive service for sure.  So we ordered the prime meatballs, shared a super salad for appetizers.  Then we ordered the Heritage porkchop, and cluster of King Crab legs, and shared the corn and Dominick potatoes.  My wife likes her meat well done, so I \"imagined\" it was cooked to her liking, she said it was very good.  My crab legs were delicious.  They were split open with a side of lemon and clarified  butter.  I would hate to see what I looked like smashing those legs, they were so damn good.  Alaskan Red King Crab probably one of my favorite foods, and this cluster did not disappoint.\n\nOverall, another solid experience, Dominick's is the real deal.  Right now, i would put them over Mastro's Ocean Club, which used to be my favorite.  I know Scottsdale is loaded with great steakhouses, but Dominick's is slowly separating themselves from the competition.  Keep up the good work!","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":2}

This is no joke, taken 3\/17\/2017 and confirmed by management that it was from one of their employees, I DARE YOU TO DENY THIS, DOMINOS!  Why did wait so long to post this? Let me explain. After taking a bite of this sandwich, I felt something crunchy in between my teeth that didn't seem to go along with the consistency of ingredients I was used to (and trust me, I am very familiar with the sandwich because it used to be my favorite). I was infuriated, as any mentally sane person would be to find somebody's full acrylic nail with jewels IN MY FOOD, and not only in my food, but in between my teeth. That has got to be the most unhygienic thing I've ever seen in my entire experience of eating food.  So I angrily drove down to the Domino's in which I ordered the pizza from (VAL VISTA AND WARNER, Gilbert AZ), mind you I had ordered delivery, but still chose to drive there in a fit of anger (can you blame me?).   The amazing Domino's customer I am, my order was over $40... I'm basically a regular.  The reason why I didn't write this review in March was because I felt that the manager I spoke with handled the situation very well (Hi Benjamin, you were awesome, and have great people skills).  He refunded me for my food, remade my sandwich, and promised me TWO orders of whatever I wanted. He said and I quote I could come in with a $70 order if I wanted to and it would be free, and I he annotate that on my account l... He was very apologetic, he said they would take care of the girl who's nail it was, and asked over and over if I needed anything else. Initially I was going to go to corporate and complain, but the way he handled the situation, I felt that there was no need. Three months later I made my first order, and had no problems.  I don't remember how much the order was, but it was quite a few pizzas more than I'm used to ordering.  Today, I went to use my second order... I'm not gonna lie, I had quite a few items on this order like last time, not totaling over $70, but hey! Unlimited is unlimited, so why not use this to feed my family who is visiting from out of town?  This is where I ran into some issues. I spoke to a different gentleman, not the same manager who help me initially, who looked over the notes and said that I was incorrect in that my order would be free.  I explained the situation, in which he replied that I was never promised a lifetime full of pizza. I am well aware that I wasn't supposed to get a lifetime of pizza out of it, but I was under the impression that my second order would go as smoothly as it did the first time.  This is what was agreed upon, and I felt that it was fair at the time of the incident.  He said that I was only supposed to get two free pizzas out of it, but out of the kindness of his heart would he take care of four of the pizzas. I told him to cancel my order. I understand that accidents happen, and sometimes employees get it wrong, which should really not be at the fault of the company, but when management deals with the problem, and comes up with a solution for the customer, the company needs to hold up their end. This is unacceptable when it comes to practicing business. I felt like I could have went all the way up to corporate and gotten free pizza for life if I wanted to, but quite frankly I'm not a greedy person. The only reason why I wanted to take advantage of this offer was because that was the offer put on the table by management.  I am absolutely done with Domino's as a company, I will never recommend this particular location of Domino's and if anyone ever inquires my opinion of Domino's pizza, I will go ahead and repeat this experience, in hopes that no one else has to eat fingernails from this billion dollar franchise!","useful":2,"funny":4,"cool":0}

It's right next to the Fashion Show Mall and across the street from the Palazzo and the Wynn. This hotel is the home base for Mystere, one of the best shows in Vegas. The rooms here are pretty nice. The standard rooms are a little on the small side but they have a nice flatscreen tv and a radio with a dock for your ipod. That was a nice touch.\n\nWhat I didn't like: the service. Aside from the guy who dropped off our bags in the room, it seemed like everyone had a damn chip on their shoulder. The people at the front desk were very rude when we were checking in. I mean these are the first people we see and the first impression means everything. We lost money here. I know, I'm sure everyone does but it's upsetting.

This place used to be one of the place I recommend to anyone I know that needs a car repair. Why? Because they are honest. But now that they have become popular, and apparently they also become very cocky. \n\nI still like the owner, but his wife is very unpleasant to talk to. I've been going there for 10 years, and I always go there to do any repairs. Except for one time, I didn't change my brake there due to the price my friend offered me is cheaper like 1\/3 of their price. \n\nSo one day, they found out that I didn't go to them to change my brake. The owner's wife  got really really pissed. With a very furious face, she told me,\"If you're only going to change oil at our place, you should find another place. Our mechanic is very expensive, we don't make money by only changing your oil!\". \n\nIf she just said nicely, I will be happy to spend the extra dollars to change my brake there. I even told the owner that I want to change it right there and paid the extra money. I am sure it's worth it. But the owner told me that the brake is still good and I don't need to change it. So I told his wife that, and she didn't believe me. She didn't think that her husband will ever advised me something like that. \n\nI was very surprised of that response. I meant, I like you guys and I know why you guys charge more for the brake, because you guys using OEM part. But hey, maybe sometimes your customer need to save money and couldn't afford to pay the premium price you offered.\n\nIt's almost like having Mcdonald told you,\"I'm sorry sir, we noticed you only buy our $1 meal but always go to KFC for the main entree. Therefore, we can't accept you as our customer anymore.\" You get the idea.\n\nMaybe you didn't realize that I have recommended ALL my friends to your place that worth way more than the stupid brake.\n\nMaybe you didn't realize now that I was treated with disrespect, I am going to tell ALL my friends about how you treat your loyal customers.\n\nMaybe you forgot the reason why you charge so low for your oil change is to attract new customers and not to kick your existence customers out.\n\nAnd maybe you forgot that I WAS the FIRST to review your business on Yelp and gave you FIVE stars where all other websites only gave you 2 stars.\n\nRegardless your reasoning, I am done taking crap from rude business owner.","useful":25,"funny":5,"cool":8}

She did not care for the salad bc she is young and the vinaigrette dressing was so strong (I loved it) so I got online to look for a restaurant that would cater to children better.  I ended up seeing on google the children's menu for mon ami. Really?

Bar seats remained open, but hey, those are off limits. We pointed out that we had been waiting over an hour. 2 minutes after we were told this, another couple came in to ask how long the wait was.

Why?  Because I used to love this place so much.  It had been a while since I was last here and I was really looking forward to a great LOS experience.  Several years ago, I ate here so often and brought in so many people that the staff even gave me a free shirt.\n\nAlas, those glory days are over.  Their portion sizes have shrunk, the prices have gone up, and the service leaves something to be desired.  \n\nI arrived early for dinner to beat the wait and when my party of 4 was seated, they only gave us 2 menus and no wine list.  After a little while, the server came over to take our drink order.  When we let him know that we wanted to order wine, but we still weren't offered a wine list.  I decided not to push the issue and went with just a glass of his choosing instead of a bottle and then placed our dinner order.\n\nOur appetizer was stuffed chicken wings.  2 chicken wings for $11.   They're good chicken wings, but not $11 good.  With a party of 4 people, I'm surprised our server didn't advise us that there would only be two.  Try putting 4 on the plate and then the pricing might make sense.  \n\nThe combination beef noodle soup was very good. I'll admit - I'm an Asian soup noodle guy.  Love the pho, wonton soup, beef stew, and ramen.  This is a nice dish that holds its own with the greats.  Beef, meatballs, noodles, fragrant broth, and garnished with fried pork skin.  Good portion at a very reasonable price.  \n\nOur Pad Thai tasted great, but the portion size was about half of what I remember them serving in the past.  Since we were all sharing dishes, it wasn't a huge deal, but it would take at least 2 of these orders to equal what you would get at most other Thai restaurants in town.     \n\nThe whole Thai BBQ chicken was meh.  Seasoning was okay, but I'm guessing it had been left over from lunch (or earlier), as it came out of the kitchen at room temperature only 3-4 minutes after ordering it together with the duck (and before our appetizer).  It had that \"stale chicken\" texture that old supermarket rotisserie chicken has towards the end of the night when it's sat under the heat lamps for too many hours and becomes mealy.  Although it's cut into pieces, the chicken is somewhat small.  Not humanely raised tasty farm chicken small though.  The parts look like they came from a 22-24oz Cornish game hen.\n\nMy biggest disappointment of the evening came to the table in the form of panang crispy duck.  This used to be my favorite dish and I was really looking forward to it.  When the entree came out, it was a fraction of the size of its former self.  The duck was not fried to order and the panang did not have the same richness and depth that it used to.  Was it horrible?  No.  Would I order it again?  Absolutely not.  I asked the server about the portion size of not only this dish, but the rest of them as well and he replied that they all appeared to be fine.  I asked why the duck portion had shrunk so much and he informed me that the portion was only supposed to be 1\/4 of a duck.  He said that he hadn't worked there very long but it's been that way as long as he'd worked there.  1\/4 of a duck with totally unremarkable panang for $25?  Yikes!  It used to be a whole roasted duck, butterflied, de-boned, and then flash fried to order for that price.\n\nThe verdict?  Completely average food, small portions, and big prices.  From now on, I'll be heading over to Spring Mt to get my Thai food fix when I'm in Las Vegas.  I have to wonder what sort of horrible Thai food that the other reviewers on here are eating which causes them to give LOS 5 stars?  Oh, how I yearn for the days when LOS was a small hole in the wall and there was still a wig shop next door.\n\nThe good news out of all of this?  The gay bar at the entrance of the Commercial Center called Spotlight (which has always been and is still very straight friendly) received a full remodel inside and out recently.  Service is fantastic and well drinks and beer are still 2 for $4 during happy hour.  So, if your heart's set on overhyped mediocre Thai food, you can still grab a drink next door while waiting for your table.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

You may only get crab legs once during your visit and there is a 7 piece limit. This results in people (understandably) picking the biggest pieces out and what remains are scraps that the restaurant won't refill until they are gone. The crab legs themselves are not the highest quality, so you frequently get pieces with very little meat in them. \n\nAlso, the dessert bar has dwindled significantly. It used to be full of different kinds of cookies and cakes. Now, there was a watered down chocolate fountain with marshmallows, peanut brittle, and a brown banana for dipping, a couple of other treats, and ice cream. \n\nThe other food is still tasty, but It's just not what it used to be.

Let me tell you, once you walk into the club through this entrance you stand at the top of the stairs and you see a see a sea of people dancing on the dance floor and then past them you see the outside lit to perfection. Everything about this club is spot on. \nSurrender used to be my favorite club in Vegas but this takes the cake. It is absolutely stunning.

They used to be my favorite. I first stayed here a couple years ago, my mom was with me and with her Marriott points we were able to get an upgraded suite. It was beautiful and with the upgrade, we were comped a free meal a day at any of their restaurants. The service was fantastic and we really felt special. Truly VIP service. \n\nBUT we just stayed here again this past weekend and I have to say the difference is night and day. Maybe because my mom didn't have enough points to upgrade us, we didn't get any special treatment? We got a basic room this time which was fine but there was so much wrong with it. Before even getting to our room, as soon as we stepped out of the elevator, the carpet was horrifically disgusting. It looked like someone changed their oil on the carpet. (Floor 43 if you want to check it out.) Then once we got to the room, we found the sliding door to the bathroom was absolutely stuck. My mom tried pushing it open and in the process strained her shoulder (it bothered her the rest of our trip). The door was stuck halfway open so anybody who wanted to shower had no privacy so we called the front desk and asked that they either switch our room or sent maintenance. We informed them ahead of time that we were in a rush and had to shower and change for our dinner reservations and show so we asked what would be quicker. They said maintenance would be there within 15 minutes. WRONG! 45 minutes later we had no update from the front desk so we called and cancelled. We even informed them that they were ruining our plans and also the fact that my mom had injured herself on their faulty door. All they did was offer a first aid kit. I then had to jump in the shower and make sure nobody walked by the door. Such a hassle! They eventually came later that night to fix the door, no apology or comp whatsoever. \n\nThere were also no perks like free breakfast or even coffee like we had the night before at palazzo. Also, apparently they're revamping all of the ice machine rooms somehow so everybody had to get their ice from the ice machine on the 14th floor. Imagine trekking from the 43rd floor all the way to the 14th when it's usually just a few feet down the hall. And their business center where we had to print our boarding passes and show tickets is run by fed ex so they charge you to be on the internet per minute and charge you also to print per page (with the exception of boarding passes.) Another thing that irritated me was the fact that they had roped off large portions of the lobby\/casino to wax the floors during peak hours on Halloween weekend. Can't they do that early in the morning when the place isn't packed wall to wall with drunks? We used to feel like royalty here, now we're glad we found better service, cleaner facilities, and cheaper rates at the palazzo which is also extremely beautiful. Never again.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Then I took a year off of the acrylics to give my nails a break.  \n\nI was excited to get a new set of nails at what used to be my favorite nail salon.

But the next day, I was still very unsatisfied with my hooves...I mean \"nails,\" so I returned to have her fix some of the lifting.  After waiting an hour, all she did was throw another coat of top coat on my nails.  I complained about the thickness, and she told me that if I wanted them thinner then I should have gotten gel nails.  I still don't know why she never suggested that in the first place! I left angry and vowed to never go in there again. \n\nA month later, they had grown out quite a bit and I decided to have them soaked off.  That was when I discovered that my nail bed was very damaged from where she filed too deeply with the drill.  It's going to take me another 2 months to grow that ugly ridge out.  She was never that heavy-handed with the drill before, so I'm not sure what has changed with her.\n\nThe bottom line: DO NOT GO THERE.  The owner has vast experience and skill, but she has become very lazy and complacent.  The work isn't good anymore, and she doesn't seem to care.  \n\nAnd it's too bad, because I used to rave about her work.  Now I'm sitting here typing a review with ugly, stubby fingernails.

They welcomed us to walk through the restaurant with my doggy to their patio. So thanks, Eric! Also, FYI, Eric is about 6' tall, white guy with a bald head in his early 40's.

However, we had just finished a movie and decided to give it a shot and order what used to be my favorite appetizer of all time, the Kung Pao Calamari.  When it arrived, my dislike of big coporate chains was reinforced with a bland dish that I had no desire to finish.  My wife felt the same way having had the earlier version.\n\nThe KPC is not what it used to be when John Carver was the chef before Red Lobster bought them out.  I admit I'm living in the past about this dish but it used to be my favorite item I've ever had in any restaurant, no kidding!  Back then it was not the rings but a calamari steak, cut into strips and the sauce was much spicier.  I think the strips may have been sauteed instead of fried but it's been too long to recall exactly.  I had this dish no less than 30 times over a few years since I was one of the regular musicians that played there; every time it was like \"I can't believe this is so amazing.\" That dish had serious flavor but, sadly, it is only a distant memory, like the hot sorority girl I met at a frat party in 1987.  \n\nTo finish on a positive note: our bartender was personable and quick with the wine.  She said the calamari was going to be amazing but, if she had tried the \"pre Red Lobster\" version I doubt she would give the same endorsement.  \n\nI know there are tons of great reviews for Eddie V's so my review doesn't amount to much in comparison.  I just wish the big corps didn't water down great and unique recipes.  We'll stick with the privately owned, local places from now on.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

In putting my business acumen to work I would speculate that all the hotels involved in the B of B got together, buy a bulk of food at a nice discount, and then just distribute it amongst themselves. That's why it doesn't stand out and that's why the quality has eroded. The toppings look old for some reason, no better way to describe it. The workers there seem miserable, I don't know exactly why.

Or in this case, the loss of customers or the rude\/angry waitress? I can't decide if I feel more disappointed or embarrassed after my last experience at Trattoria. I've hyped up Trattoria to so many friends, I hope the complete change in service and quality of food is just recent and not something that happened a while ago, because I would be so embarrassed if my friends had experienced this. \nIn the previous years I've been here, Trattoria was always filled with Japanese families and the staff were all friendly and a nice reminder of Japanese hospitality. Last week, the restaurant was completely empty on a Friday evening and there was a single waitress working the floor. This waitress was so rude\/bitter to the point that it was comical. \n10 minutes into eating, my friend's bowl of pasta was HALF EATEN when she asked him if he was done....... What was she rushing us for? The non-existent line of people waiting to get in? After for real finishing our meal, she took our credit cards and disappeared for 10+ minutes. We had to ask her what was taking so long, instead of her telling us that the credit card machine was not working. After another 10 minutes with no updates, we had to be the ones to ask if we could just pay in cash. 20+ minutes and she never thought of giving an update or giving us an alternative. Realizing we didn't have enough cash for the meal, her response was, why doesn't one of you drive to the bank and take out money. You made my Japanese side look really, really bad. Also, surprise I speak Japanese. All of your comments about how annoyed you were about us to the staff in the back were 100 percent understood by me, but I'll let that slide. \nThe pasta is better than any pasta you'll get at an Italian restaurant in the states and Japanese pasta isn't something you can order anywhere else. The non-existent competition you have is the only reason you're still open Trattoria. You used to be my favorite restaurant in Vegas, but now you're the last place I'll be recommending to friends. I would not want someone to get the wrong idea about Japanese hospitality from you guys. \nIf you do happen to come here the parking lot will be a disaster to get into, park in the neighboring lots.

For starters, no one came to our table to even ask about drinks for nearly 10 minutes after we were seated. This was on a Sunday night, in the summer (i.e. when Oakland's main residents are gone), when the place was half empty. It was a bad start for the night, for the sure.\n\nTo the kitchen's credit, the food we ordered did come out very quickly - I think we waited about 10 minutes for it. But it was tasteless compared to what it used to be. Or rather, mine was; my friend had no complaints about her chicken and rice dish. My BBQ pork soup, however, was really not good. The pork slices (the few that I got anyway) were the tastiest part of the meal. The broth was forgettable, though, and the noodles were so bland that I swore at times that my water had more flavor than my meal.\n\nIn addition to the meal putting my taste buds to sleep, the waitress continued to fail to impress me throughout the evening. For one thing, not only did she not take our drink orders promptly: she failed to bring a water that my friend ordered. She also did not check on us very regularly throughout the meal, which left us sitting and waiting for refills often. And after leaving us alone at our table for most of the night she screwed up our bills as well, and double charged one of us for both of our meals. We got it fixed, but after everything else that night we were not pleased.\n\nI wish I could say that this experience was a fluke, but based on other reviews, this is the new norm.

It was part of my 6-8 week ritual. \n\nLast week before I went out of town, I noticed that the sticker that they put on my window was not accurate for my return miles. This sticker told me I needed to return and 40,000 miles in order to get my oil changed. Not one issue number one. So I take my car back to this car wash to see if they keep track of the milage and update my sticker. I also needed to get a vehicle inspection form filled out for lyft, and thought I would ask them while Im there. I told the technician about the sticker, he said no problem, and I asked him if he could do the inspection form, he said yes. I asked him how much, he said not to worry about it. I start to walk away to the waiting area, but turn back to ask him for a car wash, might as well since Im here. I pick out which wash, and go inside. \n\nSometime later he comes in with my air filter and transmission fluid check in his hand. I asked him if he was doing an oil change, he said he already finished. I told him once again that all I wanted was the miles, inspection sheet, and carwash. He says says I needed one. This is bull crap because I was just there 2 1\/2 weeks ago for my oil change where you guys messed up my sticker. He's now pissed that he essentially gave away an unnessecary oil change for free, and then tells me he can no longer do the inspection. He closes up my car without the car wash I wanted and gives it back to me.\n\nI go home, take my daughter to tutoring, and go back home and I notice the oil leak in my driveway, look back and notice the trail of oil in the street. What are the chances???\n\nSince this carwash is already closed, I cant call and cuss out who I wanted to. I couldnt the next day because we are down one car and school started and life. But I managed to squeeze in some time that night and the night after to try and see where that leak was coming from. The way the splatter pattern should up and the oil on top of the engine, it looked like it may have been some gaskets. Que $100 and several hrs of labor later, everthing is lookin good. I start to calm down. I let the car run for a little bit, look at my engine, oil is collecting on top again. It was then that my husband noticed this pinhole sized stream of oil trickling on the side\/back of the oil filter.\n\nSo I emailed this carwash before I left town for the weekend, no response from anyone. I call and ask to speak to a manager. \n\nI proceede to tell this gentleman what my issue was, i can hair him in the background going \"uh huh\" a couple of times, and then he would interrupt me and I could tell he isn't truly listening or know what Im saying. He tells me to bring my car back in, but if he understood or listened to me, I already just that second explained we found the issue. He interrupted me a second time about not being able to do inspection for lyft forms, which I promptly retort that that's not the point. The point was your guy said he could (if he shouldn't have or  couldn't he should have said so then). He interrupts me again in my efforts in explaining my issue and I realized there is no way his incompetent ass could be the manager of this location. After telling him this, he finally gives me the name and number to a GM, which I am doubtful he is even being truthful about that. Why wasn't I given this information before talking to this fool? So the girl I talked to before this is incompetent too if she cant transfer me to the manager like I originally asked.\n\nSo now after years of passing up other carwashes to come specifically to this one at this location, my time and money with this carwash has come to an end.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Unfortunately I think I have to part ways.  Not that it will matter.  Location, location, location.  Selwyn's will continue in spite of its poor ownership and management, which is a shame.  I went there Sunday to order a pizza to go and grab a beer, watch a game while I waited.  Went to the outside bar which was relatively empty and sat down.  Looked down the row and most people had empty drinks and the guy next to me was looking to cash out.  However, the bartender would have nothing to do with that.  He was engrossed in a deep conversation with a friend.  Both looking down at a cell phone and have extensive dialogue.  Never once did he look up during the 15 minutes I sat there.  Eventually, I got up to walk inside to get service.  As I walked by the bartender and his friend, I saw they were deeply engaged in a Clash of Clans discussion.  I now understand, that can be serious work if in the middle of a war.  The patrons can clearly wait this out.\n\nWhen I went inside, the bartender inside was great.  Put my order in immediately, got my beer and was out the door 20-30 minutes later.  \n\nHere is the problem.  Whoever manages the place, doesn't really manage it.  Some people are great and attentive, however the majority of the staff could not care less about the customers.  I've had several of these instances there.  Wait staff that decide to take a food break in the middle of service, leaving us to get up and get napkins, order drinks at the bar and then finally interrupt her eating with another server so that I could finally ask to cash out.  I've waited long periods of time while wait staff breeze by, never taking an order, mostly congregated somewhere talking to each other.\n\nI love the place.  The food is good for the type of place it is.  However, somebody has to get people in place who care.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I have been here many times. This USED TO BE my favorite place to get boba like in high school lol and i have come a long way since then. Now this is my least favorite place to get boba. I never want to go here when my friends ask me and heres why. \n\nIts no secret that their boba is not very fresh or special or good BUT you get what you pay for. Their milk teas are very cheap like $2-$3. Their ice cream comes in many original-ish flavors but i do not think they are poppin. Like yeah their captain crunch ice cream tastes exactly like the cereal but is it good?? Nah. Not really i didn't want to eat it. \n\nTwo things that i do like about perfect scoop- their promotions, and their vegan options! The perfect scoop followed me on ig idk why but i followed back and they keep it pretty updated. But you have probably heard about their pokemon go promotions which is really cool & hopefully is bringing some business in. I am not vegan but i appreciate when businesses have vegan options. But i have also heard that they are like always sold out on their vegan baked goods. Yikes.\n\n Also i do not like their service! I used to go to the one on fort apache and their service was better bc it was always the owners helping me. But on jones there is always like high schoolers working who look miserable. I do not think this business strives for good customer service. Also i really don't like the vibes when i come in and the tables are always dirty. If you see their decor I think this store's demographic is younger people who sometimes don't really care for quality sometimes lol but i think they definitely can improve on the quality of their products. I have tried different bobas, ice creams, plus the macaron ice cream sandwich, and sundae. I liked their lychee ice cream and boba for a short time. Nothing else.

Nor is the customer service.\n\nWe ordered pizza for pickup, and when we got it home...wow. It was supposed to be half and half, but it was more like 1\/4-3\/4, All of the sauce was on one side of the pizza and that side just had the toppings swimming in the sauce instead of baked into the cheese. And on top of having to usually wait 30 min for the pizza, it took almost an hour. On top of it all, when we decided to actually eat it, 1. it was about half of the thickness it usually is, and 2. it wasn't even cooked all the way through\/cold. Nothing like waiting forever for inedible food! Or paying for an amount of food you aren't even receiving. \n\nWhen I contacted the restaurant and asked for a manager, I got the snottiest person I have ever talked to. He only referred to himself as \"manager\", so I'm not ever sure who I was talking too. He assured me he PERSONALLY made that pizza and I was mistaken about not only the half and half, but everything else as well. Guess my eyes are liars! Sad to say all of this because this used to be my favorite pizza place with authentic Chicago style pizza. Now I will have to search for another. A little customer service goes a long way, and you lost a loyal customer over it.\n\nOh, i did end up getting a refund, an hour and a half later, but we had to take the pizza back (so much for having an evening in) and ended up with little caesars, which was sadly a million times better than this. And a hell of a lot cheaper. \n\nSave your money folks and find another restaurant.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":0}

It used to be my favorite place to wash away my college woes, but now I don't ever want to go back.\n\nOn a Friday night in May I was out celebrating a friend's birthday with a group of 10-12 people. We were all ordering food, booze and overall having an excellent time. When time comes to mosey on home, the waitress informs me that my credit card has been lost. Problem #1: If a guest's credit card is lost, a manager should always come discuss this with the guest, not the server.\n\nThe waitress, Maddie, was horrified and worried, and suggested I leave my phone number with her so if she found it she could call me. She also gave me a comped beer, which I later found out wasn't comped but a beer she paid for herself. True true to her word I received a phone call shortly after close that night. For a variety of reasons, I was unable to pick up my card for a few days. Because of this Rula Bula put a pending charge on my credit card for $25 because my card was \"left overnight\".\n\nProblem #2: management. In conversing with the manager via email, I received excuses, and was told several times that I was wrong about the credit card charges about which I complained, even after verifying them multiple times with my card company. In my emails I also listed several shortcomings I had noticed regarding the level of service, and received absolutely no input from the manager.\n\nThere's no excuse for poor service, lost cards, non-comped drinks after such an egregious mistake, and no real apology. The managers really don't seem to care, which is an attitude that rubs off on many of the employees, save for Maddie. \n\nI'm sad to say goodbye to the best Guinness in town, but I simply can't keep justifying the poor service and lack of concern for customer satisfaction.","useful":16,"funny":6,"cool":5}

Things really have fallen apart in this place since the restaurant got expanded.\n\nOne time I went there with 3 other people, and all of us ordered Pho, and we got a tiny bit of bean sprout. So we asked whether we could get some more, and guess what the waitress said! \"WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE BEAN SPROUT.\" It was lunch time on Saturday, and a vietnamese restaurant ran out of bean sprout? We had to hold our tongue and say okay. Later we saw about 10 people ordering pho, and they all got bean sprouts of course. Why do they have to lie about that kind of stuff?\n\nAfter this incidence, me and my sister held ourselves back for the longest time, but decided to go back to try one more time. We parked our car outside at the meter, but we didn't have any quarters. So we asked the owner whether we could change a dollar to quarters, and guess what she said! \"WE DON'T HAVE ANY QUARTERS.\" Okay... I guess that might be true although it was hard to believe that a restaurant had no single quarters. So we went to the next door grocery store and bought something to get changes. After we finished eating, we paid the bill (btw they do NOT  accept credit cards any longer even though the menu even has credit card logos), and we had to watch the waitress grabbing 3 quarters for our change from a bunch of quarters. \n\nRestaurant owners should know better that YOU SHOULD NOT LIE TO CUSTOMERS. Maybe not just restaurant owners, but even little kids know this simple thing.\n\nEven pho broth used to be really good about 6 months ago, but it has changed. Sometime the broth was so clear with no flavor, I regretted ordering it. Also, they skimp on toppings in pho (different cuts of meat) which you pay extra for. When I ordered everything in my pho, there was no tendon or tripe, and they didn't even bother to mention that they ran out of certain toppings. I got disappointed for so many things for so many times. I don't go back to this place.","useful":4,"funny":4,"cool":2}

I booked a room in the Casino Tower for $69 for a Saturday night with a rate that was supposed to get me a drink credit, but when checking in, the front desk clerk just played dumb and basically told me that if I didn't see a voucher on my reservation I wasn't going to get it.

I understand that this is a party hotel and I'm no longer in my 20's, but please all you drunken idiots that like to bang on the light fixtures in the hallways at 4am, give it a break!  Some of us do like to get some sleep while it's still dark outside.  As for the rooms, while big they are pretty much a dump with broken door handles, holes in the wall and mold in the shower.  Thankfully the beds are the only saving grace still being quite comfy despite the fact that they haven't been replaced in a decade.  I realize that the 2 new towers are the place to be but it's still no excuse for renting out ratty rooms for the prices they're charging.  Based on what others have said here, I should have used Priceline to get one of the newer rooms for about the same price.\n\nOne other thing----the new Casino addition seems to lack any soul to it.  We went in there and it was virtually empty with none of the hipness of the original Casino area (with it's circular bar in the center).

I moved to Mountains Edge area a lil over two years ago before this park was even completely finished. Everything was well kept and the community took great care of its new park. But over the years the more and more people it attracted and the more people that used it's great features, the dirtier and less maintained it looks each time I come here. There's trash on the ground, which could be less likely to happen if there were more trash bins throughout the park. The park is huge so many people use it daily. It would probably help if there were park keepers that came every so often to reenforce and maintain the cleanliness of the park. Another thing I notice often when coming here during soccer games is that little children would be running around without adult supervision nearby. There was a boy about 6 years old ruining some bushes, literally breaking it apart, tearing up its branches. I walked up to him after a few minutes of him doing it and his parents nowhere in site. I asked him where his parents were and he didn't respond. A child about a year or so older came up to him and started helping the other break apart the bush. I asked them both to stop and asked where their parents were. The older one said they're walking around the park. 5 minutes later after walking away from the bush, the little one pulled his pants down and peed on a different bush. If your child isn't of the legal age of 12 to be by themselves, their should be an adult supervising nearby, where they are able to see that child. There are too many children roaming around without an adult to be responsible for their actions and a handful of these kids are the ones littering all over the park. Also, the benches by the climbing structure are not for skateboarders. There is a reason why they have those cuts on the edges of the benches, so prevent skateboarders from riding on them. I was sitting on the front bench facing the climbing structure and my daughter went around the bench and was about to sit on the back bench when a skateboarder rode on it. My daughters was a few inches away from the skateboarder. Had I not told her to come to me a second later, she probably would have had her fingers ran over.

Brisket was cold and tasted like a 2 day old left over roast from the fridge, tough and dry.  My ribs tasted off.  The meat had the smoke ring as it should but under that was disgusting. The meat was a weird grey color. These ribs were cooked from rotten meat and if that wasn't bad enough they were microwaved gain.  I sent this meal back as well.  My wife sent hers back as well. Even the sides were bad.  The hush puppies were super dark almost looked burnt but were raw dough in the center. The server refunded our meal and said don't give up on them yet. I could hear someone getting yelled at in the kitchen when we sent our food back that they cost him a customer.  I really didn't want to give up on them. I gave them one last shot last weekend. Mike Mill's was in town for the Best Damm BBQ cook off in Boulder City so I thought it would be better with him around.  We went in Friday afternoon and me and my wife ordered baby back ribs. This time they send us cold meat that was weird again. Yes the meat was ROTTEN AGAIN! Disgusting again. I know what bad meat looks like, and this was bad.  That was strike three. From someone who came  here every birthday, several Thanksgivings and other special occasions, I give up.  Its apparent that there is no longer quality control and the management is grossly incompetent. PLEASE MIKE MILLS FIX IT!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Went in, gave them 2 whole bags of clothes, with jeans, sweaters, blouses, and flannels (90% of these items were name brand and all of them were hardly used) looked around the store for about 45 minutes until they finally called me back up, and told me they could take NOTHING I brought in. So I did what everyone should do and took my stuff to the other consignment store down the road called Uptown Cheapskate. They took EVERYTHING I brought in and gave me awesome store credit, plus I only had to wait about 15 minutes for them to look through my stuff. Plato's used to be my favorite but the past couple times I've gone, they've taken hardly anything I've brought (although when I look through their selection, they have stuff with stains and holes in it), not to mention, the girls that work there are downright rude.

I used to love the Peruvian place on Dobson\/Warner next to C-Fu. They moved to Mesa, and then they closed down. I went to some other Peruvian place near by and for the first time I actually ate food from a restaurant that really want to make me gag. Ok going off tangent.... So here comes Contigo Peru. Fairly close to where I live and good reviews. The short version is, awful service on the part of OUR waitress and their food is mostly meh. 3 of us showed up at the restaurant and was seated promptly by a friendly staff. Ok so far so good.... Waited, and waited a bit before we get our menus. Waited, and waited a bit longer for the waitress to get our drink orders. BUT, she only took our drink orders and didn't ask if we wanted any starters. So we waited and waited some more and finally got our drinks and she asked if we want starters. We ordered the fried calamari. BUT, the waitress didn't ask if we are ready to order. So waited, and waited, and waited, finally I had to signal another waitress to get our waitress so we can orders in. We waited and waited and waited some more. I think about half an hour later, our calamari showed up. Oh yeah, looks like frozen calamari out of a bag. They where the little rings. No tentacles or anything. Heck, the calamari from Macaroni Grill was 10x better! Not only that, they were served with generic tartar sauce. The rings tasted like rubber bands. Chewy and tasteless. So we waited and waited some more and finally about another 30mins my gf's Pescado al Ajo came out. It's a battered a friend fish topped with butter and garlic. Smells good, looks good, but WTF are mine and my friend's dishes? Waited and waited and waited. Ok, do people not understand you serve all your dishes at a table at the same time? We are just joking about how Gordon Ramsey would be screaming and swearing back in the kitchen by now. So after a long wait, and after inquiring with the waitress, our dishes came out. I ordered the Lomo Saltado, and my friend ordered the  Tallarin Saltado de Carne, which essentially is just the same as my dish except with spaghetti instead of rice. My dish is a stirfry of fries (yes really fries you can get at the grocer's frozen section), onions, beef strips, and tomato in a soy sauce. This dish used to be my favorite. Well, all I can say is I have had much better and much flavorful than what I got. Just a note, it seems that Peruvian stir fry, they don't fully cook the veggies. Of all the places I have had this dish, the veggies are always half cooked. Just so people don't get surprised. Anyhow, their only saving grace was the fish. It was tender, flaky, and pretty good. Unfortunately, the breading for the fish was a soggy mush mess. But the fish itself was quite good. So this ENTIRE time, that waitress has not came by ONCE to check and see how we are doing. Thankfully the owner\/manager (?) did once. From what we have observed, it seems that we just happen to got the worst waitress ever. Because the other waitress was attentive and people got their food fast. Heck, even people arrived after us and ordered after us got their food WAY before us with that better waitress. We suspect this particular waitress has no clue how to wait on tables and most likely messed up our order tickets or something. So....if your are lucky and got the good waitress, maybe you'll have a great experience. We....had no such luck. Consider their food is kinda meh compare to other Peruvian places I've tried, I think I'm going to pass on going back fearing to meet the inattentive waitress again. Honestly, she was really nice when she was present. She just needs to go to waitressing school or something.....","useful":7,"funny":4,"cool":0}

To make matters worse since I was ignored by the waitress, I confronted the sushi chef and showed him how he used to prepare my sashimi deluxe platter and what he actually made me. The sashimi was literally dumped on my plate and was lacking the usual beautiful presentation. His response was that he was busy and that we had a large table.

From the outside it looks kind of tacky with that big smiley face but the product and the person who works inside makes it a place that I LOVE coming to.\n\nLet's start with the basics -- The Ice Cream. The ice cream here is one of the best I've had. I'm not a fancy pants connoisseur of Ice Cream, but I know what I like and don't like -- and I definitely like what's going on here. It's sweet but not too sweet -- just how I like it.

He may be a little slow to serve you, but that's because all of his effort is going into anything he's touching. There's a difference between ignoring a customer and making sure everyone gets the attention they deserve in the order that they came in.\n\nAll in all, five stars in my book.

If I had written my review a year ago it probably would have been 4 or 5 stars but this place just seems to have gone downhill so fast for me.  \n\nLet's start with the ridiculous amount of time it always takes to have a drink made.  If its incredibly busy I will give you a pass, but it wasn't and it took a good 15 minutes for them to arrive.  And the follow-up is if you want to charge $12 for a margarita, go for it.  But if you have the audacity to serve it in a 4 oz glass, I have a few choice 4 letter words for the person who made that decision.  They used to be bigger, but I guess someone decided since they are in South Park they can get away with that kind of nonsense.   Wine pours also seem very small, your best bet is just getting a beer, at least that is served in a decent sized glass.\n\nSo food.  I will say the calamari is still excellent and other dishes seem to have nice flavors but not always the best execution.  The pizza is just way too soggy, I mean you'd think they would be able to work something out to make it crispy but its just weak and ingredients will fall right off if you don't hold onto your slice tight!  The spaghetti used to be my favorite, so of course they changed it.  Its now served with chunks of tomato and an obscene amount of fresh parsley, as was the soggy pizza.  It used to have a light tomato sauce with a light parmesan flavor, there was no parmesan in sight so I added it  myself to make it edible.  The pasta with sausage bolognese was actually good but not really enough to make up for all the other shortcomings.  \n\nService is just a joke.  My sister's boyfriend had to get up and find someone to get us serving utensils, also his drink was made wrong and the server was kind of arguing with him.  Yea he was a bartender for years and know his shit, don't argue with him, even better he's the customer don't argue with him!

Of course they rip my a new a**hole once in a while at the tables, nothing is free, especially in Las Vegas.\nCould not believe my eyes when I checked in June 1 to find hardened spots of urine stains that would make motel 6's proud on the toilet! I chalked it up as a housekeeping faus pax and they apologized and cleaned toilet within 1\/2 hour.\nI must say when the Wynn first opened, their buffet was first-rate. Took my son there to eat and got charged 45 and 25, respectively. It was one of the worst buffets I ate. The new hotels do this quite often: start out great, then suck the customers in, lower food quality and options considerably. The rack of lamb thats carved at a station used to be my favorite. The chef cut the meat in front of me and it was ICE COLD I mean almost like it was meant to be cold. Terrible. The sushi is a JOKE they should call it \"for people who have no clue what sushi is\" section. I know I cant and dont expect yellowtail sahimi, but how much imitation crab meat laced crappy california rolls can you stomach? Crab legs another item which used to taste great now its a disaster. All I taste is sodium and water, mixed in with a \"fishy\" crab which probably has been hangin around the freezer too long. But people are so dumb and blind they keep coming back, paying 1\/2 a c-note just to eat. Every single \"hot\" entree was anything but, ranging from lukewarm to dead cold, just disgusting. Lots of quantity, minimal quality, just doesnt suit the Wynn. But again, once you make a good name, its hard to bring down and thats the case here clearly.\nPool is good, clearly one of the least noisy and spacious pools in Vegas, and of course, towels are on the seats at 9am so good luck after that finding any shade.\nCasinos. You know a dealer on the blackjack table once told me here \"you dont look like youre having fun\" I told her \"lady, I am not here to have fun I am here to win money\" For me I take playing blackjack on the tables seriously and get in a \"war\" mode. I leave the standing on soft 17's and standing on 16 vs dealer 10 to the sorry saps that boosts the casinos profit. I am a casual card-counter, and the double deck tables at the wynn and encore are decent, with good penetration but, like most casinos now, they have changed the stand on S17 rule to H17, which drives me fcuking crazy. These bastards are doing everything they can to not give you a tiny, microscopic chance of winning anything. The limits are awful, minimums are $50 before 9am and after that its all $100. I strolled to the encore to find 3 empty tables---thats 18 seats, of double deck $100 21. I asked the boss kindly if he can lower limit to ONE table to $50, he said no, jerk-off. Had dinner another night at Stratta, which was packed so assumed food was to die for. It was very average food disguised as Italian cuisine. Highlight was watching Steve Wynn enter and sit across us with his single-mom bimbo new 38-yr old gold-digger. Also, the cafe is decent but hardly memorable. A great resort thats showing a few cracks already in terms of quality slippage","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

When the dish arrived I immediatly noticed something was off, the color (used to be dark red, this was pinkish), the texture (used to be corse now smooth) of the dish looked different and the serving size (could never finish and would take half home). On top of that there were no roasted red peppers and the \"crispy\" pancetta used to be thinly sliced crispy pieces mixed in the polenta, the pancetta was chopped and just thrown on top. Then there were capers which I never recalled before and made the dish extremely salty. We complained and the manager came over, we told her we get the same dish over and over again and this time it was completely different. She apologized and was very polite but explained they rehired a previous chef and was not aware of the dish being any different since she is still new at her job.

I started to read into the menu once warned by the chef when I placed my second order of my uni.  I mean, he literally had to be rude enough to say \"This is your last order, ok?\"  I mean, I didn't know, all right?  It was the smallest print on the very bottom of the menu.  If you want customers to know, advertise it large enough so that before I placed AYCE order, I know my limitations, and I can leave without being baited by your trick.  Ok, then, I noticed the oysters also have the limit that per person, they allow you to have 12 oysters each.  We have party of two, so we should be allowed 24 oysters.  The first order -4 pieces.  The second order 6 pieces.  Then, third order, 6 pieces.  So, do the math, we still have 8 pieces to go.  Then, come the time we were ordering the last 8 pieces, the chef who has been neglecting us the whole time (he was so busy watching the baseball games on TV and attended to some Caucasian customers), shouted, \"I think you only have 6 pieces left.\"  Then, he went ahead and gave the 6 pieces to us.  WTF.  If you don't want people to order things from your menu, don't offer them.  Disclose this and lock your food up in the closet.

Don't expect your water to be filled frequently or your server to come by and check on you that often.\n\nOn my most recent visit, my parents and I shared a fried calamari appetizer. I love that they fry big pieces of the leg to give you a meaty bite. The batter itself is unique, and is similar to the batter of the chicken katsu (rather than typical calamari or tempura batter) and isn't overly greasy. But what really makes this appetizer is the dipping sauce. It's got a slightly sweet, slight spicy kick that cuts right into the heavy fried taste of the calamari. Other favorites that I would recommend are the fried oysters and the gyoza.\n\nAs an entree, the three of us shared a bento box, as well as a sushi roll special. I really don't know how one person can eat an entire bento box alone, because the three of us couldn't even finish it. It came with a miso soup, salad, assorted sushi, sashimi, nigiri, negi maki, salmon, udon, and rice! I would say that everything was average to pretty good, except for the udon, which tasted distinctly like tap water.\n\nIn general, most of the entrees I have gotten here, from sushi rolls, to nigiri, to fried options, have been pretty good, although I would probably stay away from the soups.\n\nShuhei is a good option if you are in the area and looking for a solid Japanese meal!","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

We put napkins on our lap and husband notices the dirty silverware. Of course we get a manager. This is my 4th attempt at letting Chessecake Factory turn things around and hopefully becoming  my favorite restaurant once again..\n\nShawn (manager) comes to our table after about 10 mins.  again it was busy, he apologizes and informs us he will let the kitchen know and gives his thanks to us for bringing it to his attention. Anyways, appetizers were Meh and I would NOT order them again. Different chefs these days for sure!\n\nMoving forward FINALLY here comes our brown bread with the apology that they do not have our sourdough bread as they are waiting for more. Both types of bread are standard and should be served before appetizers. This did not happen.\n\nNext my daughter and I both had salads. So I am eating mine and taste this Gosh -awful tomato I mean, \"YUCK!\" Geez, all the tomatoes taste gross like a dish water soapy taste. Yes, I have accidentally while doing dishes splashed myself and got a taste. Needless to say I avoid them and just keep eating my salad and trying to not be so aggravated eerrg. I look over she is spitting something out, like literally spitting something out. She has manners, so what is causing this?! \"The tomato is awful\" she says. It wasn't just me. OMG reader they were so bad! I'm not going to spend approx. $160 on a meal for 4 people and get sick.\n\nHere comes our meal. Still no sign of that sourdough bread that hubby loves. Meal was a chicken club for me,\"oh no,not more tomatoes!\" ok so my meal is ruined and the meatloaf,catfish and orange chicken entrees were all less then par! Last part of our meal was here and we were asked by our server James did we want that sourdough bread still? Umm yeah, NO! lol after the fact \n\nJames our waiter was great I must add!!He kept checking on us, filled our drinks and had a very professional attitude with his own style. He was cool. Only thing we liked there, was our waiter.\n\nManager Shawn could learn a thing or two about being a manager. He passed our table at least 6 times and NEVER re- checked on us asking if everything was ok. In fact he seemed to avoid eye contact with us all together!

I have always loved staying here. We paid $607.00 for a 2 night stay and it was equivalent to staying at a 2 star hotel.  The room they gave us was in the back overlooking the docks and the room looked dark and dinge. They did ask us if we wanted to upgrade to a better view for an additional fee.  We were so excited to be there we didn't care.  The curtains didn't close all the way so we had light first thing in the morning.  One of the beds sunk in so much in the middle you could feel the wood.  The waitress at the Zebra Bar took my cash for a diet coke and said she would come back with change and never did.  As we watched her, she was eating the condiments for the drinks and touching the touch screen computer and licking her fingers.  As she would stir the drinks she would put the stirrer in her mouth and suck on it before putting it back on the bar.  Then we would watch her serve the drinks to unassuming patrons.  The casino was so quiet!  Even at midnight Saturday night!  Nobody was winning.  No slots were going off.  There were even several tables with the dealers just waiting for people to come to their empty tables.  Then the kicker was on Sunday at 6am the fire alarms starting going off with a recording to stay in our rooms while they located the problem. (We had gone to sleep at 430am.)

Hotels that I have visited:  Stratosphere, Mandalay Bay, The Venetian, Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, Treasure Island, Encore, and Wynn.  Out of those places, my favorite is the Wynn for their excellent FAST service, decor, restaurants, casino floor, and staff.  I was comped three nights there with a $150.00 resort credit, the best thing ever!  \n\nRooms:\nI actually prefer Wynn's suites over Encore, to me it's just more simpler and serene.  Encore is more for groups, there's a living area, so your friends can stop by and hang out with you.  Att the Wynn, when I first walk into the foyer I feel like as if I am at home and I can jump into bed and look out the window at the beautiful strip.  If you get a chance to, you have to order room service for dinner and just take in everything and relax, then go party and gamble afterwards :-) I absolutely love their bathrooms!  The toilet is its own room which is a plus!  I love the shower head, it's like washing yourself underneath a waterfall :-).  The bedding and bed are so comfortable; you'd feel like you're sleeping on air.  \n\nRestaurants:\nThe Buffet!  Is my second favorite from RIO's seafood buffet.  Wynn's buffet used to be my favorite, but since they had taken away their flan, I stopped going.\n\nThere is a chinese restaurant at Encore, it's called Wasusu? I loved it!  I love the decor from the big booths, to how it is open so when you're eating you can also keep your eyes open to what's happening on the casino floor.  I would come here for lunch again.\n\nThe Spa:\nTheir spa is heaven!  I absolutely loved The Wynn's spa and I will definitely be coming there again.  If you do go, please make sure to arrive there at least 2 hours in advance so that you can take advantage of their spa amenities and then have your service.  Right when the elevator opens, you'll notice the difference in ambiance and their reception area is so welcoming.  I like to lounge around there for a few minutes and just relax while waiting for a friend.  Make sure to drink their teas and have some fruits :-).  My only regret was that I did not use the amenities enough last time I went, I had booked my appointment right away and didn't have time to enjoy the rest.  Ooo ladies, this is European style, but you can also wear a bathing suit of course.  I prefer going Euro ;-).  \n\nThe Wynn Theatre:\nI'm very picky with my theatres and where I see my shows or concerts.  I hate The Staples Center or the Honda Center in California because the layout is NOT for concerts, sound just floats everywhere and you can't hear anything! ugghhh pet peeve....  Wynn's Theatre is not like that, you have the stage and the audience fans out, like how a theatre is suppose to be.  Their sound system is amazing, I saw Le Reve here and I absolutely loved it.  Such a different experience and no matter where you sit, the performers are not tiny, where you'd like binoculars.  Granted, I have seen all the Circus Du Soleil show, my favorite is \"O\", absolutely amazing!  The reason is, I love to swim and their show is just wonderful in the water.  Any Circus Du Soleil show would be great to see, just depends on your budget.\n\nGolf Course:\nPlease please please, go visit the golf course!  It is awesome!!!\n\n\nI think that covers it!  Let me know if you guys have questions and I'll try to answer! ooo and my luck at the Wynn on the penny machine won me $500.00, so that was a bonus!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Joey bought it and eventually stopped serving food late night since the poor choice of allowing bartenders to blast rap and hip\/hop music to a crowd that wasn't really fond of it drove a lot of their regulars away, resulting in a loss of funds late night.  So individuals like myself who usually only hang out and drink after eating a meal or during were left disappointed. \n\nMeredith went to day shift, where it's near impossible for me to get with my schedule, but it was frustrating to have someone with such a tremendous personality and a regular customer following to just vanish on her regular crowd.  \n\nTheir food has some great dishes.  The breakfasts have touches such as onion\/pepper\/potato mixes in lieu of hash browns and they are seasoned well and a lot of their food is excellent bar food.

The portions for soup and salad are on the larger side.\n\nThe decor looks like Gaston from Beauty and the Beast had go at the place with antlers all over.  I LOVE the comfy wing chairs.

The lights are super bright and crazy also sometimes they throw confetti which looks cool in the light. \n\nMusic: I would say XS competes with Marquee big time, both clubs are the major bookers for headliners. Like Skrillex, Calvin Harris, Dada Life, Afrowack, etc. because this club is \"up there\" they have to book big. They throw crazy parties. This place is huge especially during summer but I went when Afrowack was playing. The place wasn't so packed but they again I think I walked in like 1:30AM LOL \n\nDancing: I was surprised there was a lot of room to dance on the dance floor, but my friends and I found ourselves near the strippers poles. A lot of girls were dancing there too and oddly no one was mean or bitchy. \n\nLine: there's no guest list on the weekends so don't even try, we walked in with a promoter plus we had 6 girls so its never hard for a big group of girls to get in but the line was ridiculously long even at 1:30AM when I decided to hop over after visiting surrender and tryst to finally end up at XS lol..\n\nBouncers: At XS they don't mess around trust me, no sense of humor for a drunk girl like me. Thank god I didn't kicked out. Bartenders didn't go to the bar but I passed by it, super busy at all times. Drinks were probably over priced but that's Vegas for ya.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":4}

I went over my 30 minute lunch break because after finally having the chow mein available, the lady serving filled orders for customers who had just walked in rather than prioritizing myself and the few others that had already waited for over 20 minutes.\n\n3- Went through the drive thru and ordered a bowl with chow mein and walnut shrimp. Got back to work and the bowl wasn't even filled up half way! The bowl is not very big to begin with and they didn't even fill it up. It was a waste of $7!\n\n4- went through the drive thru again. I ordered a plate with chow mein, orange chicken and mushroom chicken. I got back to work and saw that they gave me some spicy dish instead of the mushroom chicken I asked for, even though it also said mushroom chicken on the receipt. \n\n5- Ordered chow mein and got back to work and saw the noodles didn't have any sauce(?!) it was like the noddles were cooked to soften then served as is.\n\nI don't even know why I bothered giving it so many go's after always having something wrong about my order or negative about the experience.

I was craving Italian food and was hoping to rekindle the good memories I've had there with the bf. Unfortunately, that never happened. We walked up to the hostess and were served a major helping of ATTITUDE! \n\nWe did not have reservations, but there were many empty tables inside. We were told that we would have to sit at the table outside of the restaurant which we did not want to do. She rudely told us that it would be \"at least a 45 minute wait.\" We were annoyed, but put our name in and went next door to grab drinks at Comme Ca. \n\nAs soon as we sat down for drinks, the snotty woman came over and informed us our table was ready. What happened to the 45 minute wait? Very suspicious. Again, we felt major cold shoulder from her. We were so fed up that we decided to just eat dinner at Comme Ca, where they went out of their way to get us a table with an amazing view. \n\nThe food may be good at DOCG, but a restaurant is only as good as their customer service, which was a huge fail.

Comparatively to other Halloween events at amusement parks (Howl-O-Scream, Fright Fest), Carowinds has a while to go before they get to that caliber. \nI came here on a Friday night, and yes, of course it's crowded. Of course Fury has a 1.5 hour long line. You HAVE to come in knowing these things, or at least expecting them.\nArriving here around 7pm, we had time for 2 coasters and 3 mazes. Hurler was as jolty as ever (still fun, it's just starting to make my head hurt a little now!), and Intimidator was running beautifully so the 30 minute long line was fine. \n\nAs for mazes, we went through Zombie High, Silver Scream Cinema, and Dark Harvest. Zombie High used to be my favorite, but things have kind of been cut back. Silver Scream is always fun, lots of neat effects in there.\nDark Harvest plays a horrible 3 chord banjo recording over. and over. and over. and over. and over. and over again in line and I just NEED IT. TO SHUT. UP. \n\nMoving on :) \n\nThe maze itself was pretty cool. It seemed like it was stemmed from the old corn stalkers and had a lot of the same elements, but it took you through a barn and a house as well, where there was a loud flash bang that was set off every couple of minutes. You could hear it from the line, which built suspense.\n\nThe actors are fine, a lot of them are kids who are doing this very part time, and they break character a lot and go and talk to each other in plain sight. I especially love the people who have the flint knee and elbow pads that run and slide at you. Super awesome. \n\nOverall, decent theming, okay scares, and long lines. Ambiance is done well too, with lots of fog machines and dark music playing throughout the park. I'll keep on coming as long as people keep on inviting me, but it's not too worth it if you don't have a pass and pay full price.\n\nPS. One more thing, what is this about the skeleton keys?

The chimichangas used to be what this place was renowned for. They were huge and relatively inexpensive (around $8). They seem to be more compact now and almost look like they're prepared off-site and then heated up when you order.

There are some things that seem to have gone downhill, but also some really great things about the shop as well. \n\nThe cupcakes:\nHaving taste-tested cupcakes from many different Charlotte bakeries, Poika Dot has THE BEST frosting. I think it is the best tasting, has the best consistency, and there is the right amount on each cupcake. The cake itself is highly variable. It seems the chocolate cake is usually more moist\/fresh tasting than the vanilla-based cakes. Most of the recent cupcakes I've tasted have been dry. Finally, I don't think the selection of cupcakes is very good. There have been several days where I wanted to stop by for a cupcake, but didn't want any of the flavors they were offering. This is personal preference, but if you don't usually get the standards (vanilla, chocolate, red velvet,) there aren't as many to choose from as other bakeries. \n\nThe service:\nThere are always several people working, and they are typically all sitting down either chatting or looking at their phones. I would agree with previous reviewers that the interactions seem awkward; they don't seem genuinely friendly or happy to serve you. When I've asked for descriptions and opinions on particular cupcakes, many times the employee couldn't describe the cupcake and had to look it up or ask someone else in the shop. \n\nOther goods:\nI LOVE the black and white cookies, and have ordered pies that were delicious (apple cream cheese and chocolate\/peanut butter).","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

In order to do that we need to do some research first before we embarrass ourselves in front of our guests. We follow yelpers' advice and visited this place. \n\nVery pricey ($48) for 10 pcs of nigiri, dessert, a tiny glass of 2% sake and hand roll. The price also goes up to $80 or $120 for a full course meal per person. I ordered the $48 and my husband got the $80 meal. I have to be honest that if you are there to have your stomach filled you should order the $48. No, you're not going to feel full, but you can order extra pcs of nigiri (premium fatty tuna at $7 a pc and the price goes down to $2 for egg nigiri) \n\nThe most impressive thing we had on the menu that day was the extra pcs of kamashita fatty tuna nigiri we ordered separately. NOTE: it wasn't selected by the chef to come with our (I'll leave it to you meal\"). The chef told us there's more marble fat than the premium fatty tuna (same price), it's from the collar of the fish. Not only do they melt in your mouth but it also makes the rice taste amazingly good. Compared to the premium fatty tuna, it's a lot better. The PFT was stringy for both of us. I had to spit out the unchewable bit and my husband took the patience to chew down the stubborn string.\n\nNext thing that left an impression is the raw giant scallop nigiri, it tasted sweet... My husband got the $80 meal but he was not impressed with it. We decided that it wold be better to go with the $48 meal next time so we can have enough money to order separate pcs. The chef are Japanese and it's hard for me to read what they're thinking because they seldom smile at first but after the 4th pc of fish our chef got less serious. But you kind of have to pay close attention to their eyes, they give you very good suggestions to what is good and fresh that day.\n\nMakino AYCE used to be my favorite sushi place but after I had omakase style sushi it ruins Makino for me. I will still go back if I have cravings for sushi and don't have a fat wallet for sushi. Total bill at Kabuto comes out to $176 without tip. This includes us ordering a total of 6 extra pcs of nigiri that did not come with the meal. Overall if it wasn't the price, it was a very fun experience.

We waited forever before our server arrived, waited forever for our food, and when our food did arrive, it was cold. We ate it anyways as we had been waiting forever and were hungry but politely informed our server, to which she flippantly replied that \"it had been a busy night.\" I was embarrassed as I was the hostess of this party and our experience put a major damper on our evening. I wrote them on Facebook informing them of my experience, and the owner kindly sent me a response back asking for my address and informing me that he would send a gift card as a token of his apology. I was touched by his kindness and decided to give the restaurant another try, so I sent him my address but the gift card never arrived.\n\nI give the restaurant a 3 because up until my past few experiences here, the food had been excellent.

At Stonecrest, our cold sides for fajitas were put under a heat lamp and the lettuce was all burnt.  Who does that???  The other thing I noticed, at both locations, they prepped the plates way in advance of the main dish and stuck it under a heat lamp until the main dish was ready.  The top of my beans were singed.  This is on more than one occasion, too.  The heat lamp appears to be akin to a microwave in a bad restaurant here.  In Europe, they bring each dish out when it's ready so no heat lamp is necessary.  I wish we'd be more like that in the US rather than trying to hold up dishes to serve altogether.  It rarely works.  Someone's dish is going to be subpar doing it that way.\n\nThe last time we ate there, so many things were wrong, we complained to the mgr.  We are generally not complainers.  I will say the management made it right.  They comp'd the entire meal.  However, we've struggled to have the desire to go back - we even have a 50% off coupon to use!!!\n\n\nAt Dilworth, the wattage in the pendant lighting was so bright we were squinting the entire time (not joking.)  We even sent an \"anonymous text message to the manager\" about it.  It was horrible.  Also, the music was so loud, we were practically screaming at each other.  Restaurants, please, if you have to scream to hear yourselves talk to each other, the music is TOO LOUD!  I'm not an old fuddyduddy.

This show USED to be my favorite.  It used to be so full of heart, soul, beauty, depth and honesty.  It used to have a really wonderful spooky feel and emotional arc.\n\nNot technically a Cirque du Soleil show, it was developed by the capable hands of Benoit Jutras, who had done work with Cirque in the past.  He made it really wonderful.\n\nThen, two things happened: Wynn started to pander too much to focus groups, and spent multi-millions of dollars on lighting for the show.  Focus groups can be damaging: just because you don't like something doesn't mean it should be removed from a show (for example, we don't like villains, but we need them for a good show).  Basically, uneducated opinions (sounds pretentious, I know, but those without art structural backgrounds) ruined the show.  The lighting turned the show into the Bellagio fountains with some acrobats flitting all over it. \n\nWhy do people believe we are so stupid that we only want movement and color?  That we don't need a plot, honesty, or heart?  Not even kids are that rudimentary.  It's insulting.\n\nNow, Le Reve is basically a wet Lite-Brite that has no teeth, heart or soul.

The chicken is a full breast of chicken with Corn flakes and a few other things on the outside then deep fried.

It USED to be my favorite pool party in Las Vegas. The atmoshhere is great, but it comes at a premium. It is usually around $100 to walk in the door, and mixed drinks are about $65 each for their 'party' type cups (around 32 ounces probably) you are inside. This is not outlandish for seeing a top DJ at a pool party in Las Vegas by any means, but it is still a tad more expensive than anywhere else. I am okay with that since I really used to like this pool party. This particular time, my trip to this pool party probably ran me somewhere near $500 in total. After leaving and barely getting out the door, I realized I left my phone in the $75 locker. This meant I couldn't get an Uber back to Mandalay Bay where I was staying. Mandalay Bay is also the furthest possible hotel on the strip from where we were at. Within a minute or so after walking out the gate, I asked if i could get back in just to get my phone. This is where things started going downhill fast. They refuse reentry as a policy, which is understandable. I could either try back hours later in the night and see if they found my phone, pay $100 to get back in, or get treated like total crap trying to convince the man at the door to let me back in. After being talked down on and sworn at by the manager\/bouncer, I eventually gave him the finger and was escorted off the premises. Keep in mind this didnt happen until well after being respectful and just seeing if the man could help me out after an honest mistake. All of my friends were back inside still by the way. He would not grab one of them to get my phone for me or anything. After this scumbag swearing at me and berating me after asking how he would feel if he were in my shoes, he basically did everything but get physical with me. They could really try being a host for people spending a lot of money there and be understanding, or they can treat people like garbage. After this whole experience, I was eventually escorted off the property for giving him the finger after this whole debacle and being treated like trash. This is super disappointing since I really do like the pool party, but they will never receive my business or my friends' business again. The absolutely inhumane treatment I received here was absurd. Thankfully, my friends were still inside and grabbed my phone when they left. Save yourself the lacklustre treatment the management is willing to provide if anything goes less than perfect.

When I first found them years ago, I would've easily given them a 5 star review. Since that first experience, I've noticed a slow decline. The food is still good but now borders on pedestrian. Attention to detail and service kept me coming back.\n\nUnfortunately, I have now had the one bad experience that prompts cathartic writing and has me questioning if I will ever bother again. A dining experience is one part food and one part service. On the food side, it's an increasingly difficult battle. As palates become more trained, it is more difficult to find flavors that surprise. So it's best to find a meal that entices. The trap of mediocrity begins with commercial concessions. When the commercial concessions are more prevalent than the enticement of your food; artistry becomes lost. Due to the nature of the business, I cannot knock them too hard for this decline. They are still better than most, but not worth a special trip.\n\nWhat is really prompting me to write this review is the service I just had. The decades I've spent in the restaurant industry taught me one lesson above all others in regards to service. The only things that truly matters are beverages. It doesn't matter if your customers are drinking water, wine or carbonated corn syrup. If the condition of their drink ever becomes a worry in their head, service is lost. That is the experience I had today. An eternity passed after I finished my my cocktail and meal. It wasn't until my water glass was almost dry before anyone looked at me or asked me a question. \n\n\"Would you like more water?\" The person wasn't even my server. My answer, \"How about an espresso, aperitif, and dessert menu?\" She seemed a bit shocked by my response. I don't blame her. After being ignored for so long, I was feeling unwelcome and trying to not be snippy. Maybe I wasn't successful. She had the look of someone new to the industry and the way the bartender interacted with her only served to solidify that impression.\n\nYou can do a lot worse for food on the strip, but does that matter if you're not made to feel welcome?","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

There was a Manager named Conrad who retired , he seemed a little laid back , some workers loved him the others did not . It didn't matter to us , when he was there everything went off without a hitch , no kitchen errors , great service , hot food with cold garnish and not dried out rice.

Last time I got it (just last week), you could get $20 of food for $11, and the food is already priced fairly.\n\nOne thing I found unique about this place, and I'm not sure why other Mexican places don't do it, is that they bring a bowl of refried beans with the chips and salsa.  I regularly found myself clean two bowls of those beans before ever getting my food.\n\nI've only had one dish here: chicken enchiladas.  I get two, one red, one mole.  Mole sauce isn't an option on the menu, so you just have to ask for it.  If you love large portions, this is the perfect place to come.  I always left over-stuffed, and I rarely finished my plate.\n\nAll told, with the Groupon, you and a friend can get two entrees and only have to pay about $5 additional dollars.

That being said, Echo & Rig, culinary-wise, might just be in my top 3 favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  Their downfall is 80% of the staff and service! \n\nI started going there a couple if months ago and my first experience was amazing!! Since January I have been back AT LEAST 10 times and have been disappointed most of those times.  I return because the food is THAT GOOD (that is, IF I receive it, or if the kitchen staff cares to sear the meat right). \nFirst time I went, it was during lunch.  The server was casual but his recommendations were spot on.  Lunch was delicious and server was helpful friendly.\n\nReturned several times after that (a couple nights back to back).  There are two evening hostesses that ALWAYS remember us, which makes us feel welcome.  However the staff upstairs acted too busy or were overwhelmed with tables.  Only a few times we were offered bread when we sat.  Offered the cuts of the house only once since I've been there.  Once they mixed the sparkling water with the still water.  Found a hair in our soup and they did nothing but take it off the check, did not offer a replacement or an apology.  One waiter made us feel bad about not ordering an alcoholic beverage.  Waiters seem rushed or impatient.  Management seems unconcerned.  Complained to a manager who did absolutely nothing and appeared completely uninterested.\n\nWent for lunch once and, I kid you not, there were approximately 4 other tables there.  Ordered the Portabello Fries (YUM by the way) had a view of the kitchen and watched as it sat for 30 min while I ate the rest of my meal, all the while the cooks, waitstaff and management walked past it many times without a single person commenting who's dish was sitting out under the warmer.  Also asked for a coke, which didn't arrive.  At the end of the meal (fries STILL up in the warmer) I was presented with a check that still had the fries and coke.  Mind you there were only 4 other tables present. \n\nAlso have issues with getting my table bussed, usually plates pile up before someone comes and clears them.  Also they'll take your silverware before you're even done.  \n\nPositive notes: food is amazing.  Flat iron steak is my favorite and 9 out of 10 times it's seared right and cooked perfectly.  Portabello fries are always a favorite, Carne Asada bone marrow delish.  Love the grilled octopus but every so often it's tough.  Black spaghetti used to be my favorite until they changed the scallops to mussels.  Crispy bacon is decadent.  Ultimate BLT was one of the first things I tried and nothing short of amazing but have had it since and it didn't quite measure up (the bread seemed old).  Decent wine selection, white sangria is tasty, cocktail selection is ok.  They used to have a chaucuterie board that was really good but I no longer see on their menu.  Downstairs has fresh squeezed juices that they should put at least on their lunch menu, I am always curious about them but never know what they have.  Steaks are amazing, I have had several different cuts and all are tender and delicious (they should be, they're a butchery!) and prices are great, especially compared to a steak house on the strip.  All their meats or all natural grass fed.\n\nHave been hesitant to return because of service, have returned solely because of the food, only 2 stars because of overall experience.  This restaurant definitely deserves better.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Ten years ago while I was in high school, (gawd. I feel old) this used to be my favorite store.  It was a great place to find unique\/alternative clothing at a decent price.  Better yet, I was apparently a stylish young thang because whenever I cleaned out my closet and took it here, I would get at least $65 in store credit to get some new digs.  \n\nThese days,  I feel like Buffalo relies more heavily on the brand than they used to.  Its not uncommon to find used jeans here for $60 or jackets for $45 - all because of the label.  I'm sure its still a great bargain, its just not \"nice thrift store\" that I grew up on.  Its also become increasingly difficult to sell my clothing here - if I bring them 10 items, I'm lucky if they take one.  \n\nThey need to figure out a way to improve their line to sell stuff.  I went in last night and there were 6 people already waiting with ONE employee \"buying\" things.  I knew I actually wanted to look at clothes before I had to make dinner, so I threw my bag of stuff I wanted to sell in the car and just went inside to shop.

I was so excited to take her there because it has always been a favorite spot of mine, but I hadn't been there in a while and \"Oh Lordy!\" has it changed.\n\nMy primary complaint is in regards to the appallingly bad service we received.\nWhen we arrived, we went up to the hostess, who told us we could sit anywhere we liked.  After seating ourselves, we waited about ten minutes without menus and finally had to ask a server if we could have some brought over.\n\nAfter about five minutes of looking over the menu, our server finally greeted us and let us know she was sending some waters over. We also ordered mimosas.  Another five to ten minutes later, our water finally arrived, warm, because the two or three measly pieces of ice that had been in them were almost completely melted already.\n\nAnother five to ten minutes later, our mimosas finally arrived, though I hesitate to even call them that.  There was so much pulp in them that an inch of it pooled at the bottom and the whole drink was filled with hairy orange flesh. We politely sent them back and asked for coffee instead.\n\nAs we waited an additional five minutes to get our coffee, we observed the tables around us. The man sitting at the table next to us had brought his dog and asked for some water for the dog. My friend and I, already pretty steamed by this point, couldn't believe it when we saw the dog's water was fuller and colder than ours had been.  Eventually we received our coffee and our food, which was fine, though both of our dishes were severely lacking in seasoning. \n\nAfter we paid the bill, but before we left, my friend went to talk to the manager.  She had tried to catch his eye earlier, but even when she did, he did not come over. When she went up to him, he was sitting down eating with a woman who didn't appear to work there. She asked if he would mind stepping aside so she could speak to him.  He didn't even get up from his chair to speak with her, he just asked what she wanted.  She then proceeded to tell him that she was disappointed with the service we received.  He didn't apologize, but asked who sat us, and she told him we hadn't been sat, we were told to seat ourselves.  She tried to continue to explain the issues we had, but he was so disinterested and ambivalent about everything she said that she finally told him she could tell he didn't care what she had to say and was sorry to have wasted his time. He just said \"Okay\" and let her walk out without another word said.  \n\nWe left with a sour taste in our mouth from the experience, or maybe that was just due to some leftover pulp still stuck in our teeth.

The sushi rice was old and the wasabi was not its usual bright green color.  Again, I know Sasa so we will probably go back in two weeks despite this one bad experience but if we have this same low quality food next time, it will be our last visit.  It's just too expensive to have low quality food.  I have not seen the owners for a while so I wonder if it is under new ownership.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

None of us could pick up our burgers, and I got so frustrated eating mine I took a few bites and gave up. How do you expect us to eat a burger with chocolate drizzled on top?

It was soggy and mushy. \n\nOn the last day of vacation, I decided to order a salad to go. It sounded really delicious and I decided to give it a second chance. HUGE MISTAKE. The garbage salad was literally what it sounds like - garbage. The meats were so dry and the lemon dressing had a thick consistency, almost of mayo. The lettuce was soggy and I couldnt take more than a few bites. What also upset me was I called in the salad at my hotel. By the time I got there 20 minutes later, my salad was still not ready. Heres the kicker, there was NO ONE in the restaurant. Literally. So tell me why it took 40 minutes to throw cheese and meat on a salad? Seriously?

The Caribbean theme is unique when compared to other restaurants in Pittsburgh, and they really do it well.\n\nSome of the food I've had there include the following (spoiler alert: I like everything I've ever had here...):\n\n--Jamaican Jerk Wings - so good! The sauce is tangy and the wings are cooked just right.\n--Yucatan Hot Bean Dip - it's a heavy, thick dip, but it's really tasty and cheesy, mild on the spices.\n--Tropical Guacamole - really tasty, pineapple and the mango in this give it a sweet and fresh flavor\n--Caribbean Flank Steak Stir Fry: had this most recently.. OMG. My boyfriend kept trying to steal bites. It is a huge portion, the steak is cooked perfectly and there is a lot of it. The flavors just go together so well!\n-- Crispy Fish Tacos - this used to be my favorite menu item before I experienced the steak stir fry. The portions of the fish are really generous and cooked to the right amount of crispiness, but be wary of the spicy crème fraiche, it's REALLY spicy. \n-- Fried Chicken (on Thursdays) - my boyfriend makes sure that we only go on Thursdays so that he can order the fried chicken. It's really fresh, hand battered, and you get SO MUCH. He tried the Nashville hot once, and it is no joke. We found it too spicy to actually be enjoyable. \n\nIn summary, make a reservation, be cautious of anything advertised as \"spicy\", because they do not mess around with the spices, but otherwise, everything here is SO GOOD. The service is always on point, and they have an awesome draft and cocktail menu.

We went about once a week for almost a year. The change of ownership has caused this place to go completely downhill. Luckily the shaved ice still tastes the same. Whew! \n\nThe bad news is the place is run by teens and or young young adults and the quality of service and care of cleanliness has been eliminated completely. \n\nOne time I came in and a male worker was hanging with his friends eating pizza at the customer's tables and watching videos on youtube and on fb, etc. I understand it was slow, but this seemed inappropriate to someone like me and my hubby who were trying to have a date night and get to overhear stuff I did not want to hear. \n\nOther times the workers are so busy gossiping, chatting, and giggling that they literally ignore customers and talk amongst themselves. Ummm hello, I am standing here and being ignored. Not good. \n\nToday I walked in and it was warm and smelled like onions in there.  The floors were trashed, black marks covering the floors, looked like there was some sort of rainstorm outside and people tracked in a bunch of crap. They really need to clean the floors! In addition the work station had food all over the floor. \n\nI also witnessed an employee who got my shaved snow in the cup then went through the curtains to the back to gossip while my snow began to melt and she was chatting it up laughing with employees instead of finishing my snow toppings. About 8 people walked in during that time and with 3 employees chatting and gossiping, they were all left to wait while the employees were behind the curtains talking. I am also concerned gloves are warn but then used to open curtains and the dirty towel was handled before touching my snow toppings with her hand. Be cautious of what you touch when you have gloves on. \n\nI understand it must be hard to keep employees, but literally every time I have gone in the past few months I have not seen one familiar face. There is a high turnover of employees which I can see is why there is such awful things happening to this business. I wish they would get someone in there who is more long term and care abut cleanliness and customer service. \n\n3 stars because the quality tastes the same to me. They lost their 5 stars in my opinion due to the dirty floors and food handling as well as customer service.","useful":13,"funny":8,"cool":7}

Since the machines don't take quarters, only tokens, she went to the counter to ask for a dollar bill to put into the change machine . The guy behind the counter snapped at her and told her they don't give out change. When I asked him to please give her change so she could play their video games he said to me \"we don't give change and it's not his problem.  If I didn't like it I could go talk to his manager\" then turned his back and walked away. The shift manager came out and apologized and gave her change. He said he would make a point to speak with the employee and to also have the store manager contact me. I've since called back again and left another message and still the store manage has never called me back.

The people at the front desk were extremely rude and aloof, the types that act like they're better than you. Then they couldn't figure out how much we were supposed to be charged. And it was the BIGGEST deal that we wanted to put the room charge on a different credit card from the one we booked with, but they couldn't do it. Well they sort of could, because they charged both credit cards. Then when I called to complain they told me that I WAS WRONG and had to have my credit card company dispute this. Furthermore, in the whole of the hotel they claimed they didn't have a room with a king bed. So my husband and I had a romantic weekend in separate beds. THANKS HARD ROCK! \n\nThe only thing that wasn't a total disgusting vile nightmare was room service. They were respectful, gave me what I ordered, polite and efficient. If I could stay at a hotel just based on room service then I'd still stay at the HRH. \n\nTo top it all off, I went to one bar for a drink, was the only person at the bar, was completely ignored for 10 minutes.

I have been going to your restaurants for all of these years.   It used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant, I can tell you now it has fallen not only past the bottom of my list but completely off the list of not just Mexican Restaurants but all restaurants.   I will not come back, nor will I ever recommend it.\n\nHere is what happened.    We came to the Tatum Blvd one Sunday evening about 6pm.    There were maybe 10 tables with people, not busy at all.   I was with my wife and 2 kids, we were seated right away and our waiter was nice enough at first.    My son ordered the #52 as he always does, my wife ordered #24 but thought she was ordering #21, my daughter ordered her customary Cheese quesadilla from the kids menu and I ordered #39 (thought I'd try something different.).   First off my sons, silverware was dirty, (set ups) he simply took some from another table, seemed like not a big deal at the time.   Then when my wife's meal came 5 or so minutes late after everyone else's it was the Vegetarian Burrito not the Fajitas she thought she ordered.   Rather than trying to make it right for her the waiter became argumentative and told her that is what she ordered and gave her no option.    What makes this interesting is she ordered it as #24 but said to the waiter she wanted the Fajitas.   Her mistake but is the customer always right?  Should the waiter try to make her experience correct even if she made the error?   Should we have had the option of getting her the meal she wanted-even if you offered at a cost to us?    I did get my order and it wasn't as good as I expected but it was what I ordered, 1 BIG Standing tray of food, but not a Plate to be had.   Consequently, I dropped a Chorizo covered spoon on my clothing because I had this elevated monstrosity of a serving dish in front of me but no plate to eat of off.     Lastly but probably the most important was my son's dinner.   It seems he had a HARD FOREIGN OBJECT in his re-fried beans; it looked and felt like a pebble.   We pointed that out to our waiter, he response was: \"I'm sorry.\"    I would have thought we'd see a manager by that point but we did not.   I would think a HARD FOREIGN OBJECT which  was clearly not food in my son's beans warranted a free meal if not our entire bill given as complimentary.   You could have had some expensive dental work to pay for.   \n\nHere is the deal.   I am not happy, my wife is not happy, and my son is not happy and begged us not to go because we have had either bad service, messed up food orders, plus I have even had Chicken bones in my food in the past.   In fact I remember a time when he ordered #52 with beef before got it with chicken instead and they brought him an entire 2nd meal because of the error.    My 9 year old daughter is the only one in the family that likes it; plus it's pretty had to mess up a Cheese quesadilla (her order every time).   Here's the other tidbit of knowledge she doesn't get to be the one who buys dinners out, I am.    The consumer votes with dollars and I will cast my vote to not spend them in your restaurants again.  \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts I am very interested to know.   I paid with a credit card the bill totaled $49 and I tipped only $5 because of the sub standard service, I am sure you can find my order in your records.   I have probably had over 100+ meals from your restaurants over the years and I must say the Phoenix stores or should say at least the one at Paradise Valley Mall is terrible.   I don't think I ever had a bad meal at the Speedway location but I moved to Phoenix over 10 years ago and do not go to that location any longer, I cannot say the same for this location.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

But my wife and I just had an unsatifying HH experience there recently.\n\n- One early Fri evening inmid-August, mywife and I came here for happy hour again and were disappointed that:\n(1) They NOT ONLY took away our favorite \"Fried Zucchinis\" from the Happy Hour Food Menu,\n(2) BUT ALSO, the entire bar menu now contained a grand total of ONLY ONE ITEM, i.e., Flatbread! Luckily the flatbread was delicious.\n- Well, my wife and I used to bring our out-of-town guests here for happy hour and dinner. The place was almost always very crowded with happy customers in the PAST, especially during its happy hour. But, on this Fri evening (around 5:30pm),the bar area was PRACTICALLY EMPTY, with only 2 tables occupied and only ONE customer at the bar counter! We thought it could have a lot to do with the now VERY LIMITED HAPPY HOUR MENU, our nice and efficient waitress agreed.\n- Well, one more good point: We were nevertheless pleased that they still give out their best tasting warm bread FREE, which tasted heavenly especially dipped in olive oil\/basamic vinegar!\n\nBOTTOM LINE for HH:\n- Due to the diminished value and the \"Empty-Space-Atmosphere\" (on a Fri evening at that!), I'd now give it only 3 Stars for HH.\n\nOn the other hand, to be fair, just back in March, we brought friends over there for dinner (NOT HH), we did have a fabulous time, with tasty dishes, drinks and superb service! So, we wish that Maggiano Management would do something to bring back their popular HH menu and fill its place again for HH!\n- Hints: Please put back \"Fried Zucchinis\", and perhaps even add \"Crab Cakes\" to its Bar Menu, which is a GREAT HIT on Schottsdale Maggiano's HH Menu anyway!\n- Until then, I could still go there for a good dinner, but will not likely go back there just for happy hour.\n\nPeterskis, August 2012","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":4}

I have always been impressed with their service, prices and the fact that you get a hot stone massage with your pedicure (so hard to find!) so it is very hard for me to give this place a bad review. However,  I feel like maybe if I post this the management will look at it as an opportunity to improve in a few areas.  \n\nUnfortunately the past couple of times I have been here I have been extremely disappointed.  Time before last I asked for the girl to paint a bumble bee on my big toes.  I specifically asked her if she knew how to draw one and she said yes.  Let me tell you it was the WORST toe art I've ever seen.  It looked like a child had drawn it on.  I'm not a very confrontational person so I just politely nodded and said yes when she asked if it was ok.  The man who actually did my pedi cut my cuticle and made me bleed.  I'm not talking a few drops of blood here I mean really bleed.  There was blood all in the water and all over my foot.  It was extremely painful and I even let out a sound when it happened.  He was just laughing and saying it wasn't that bad.  He never even said he was sorry. \n\n I swore that I wouldn't go back but a few weeks ago I found myself in the neighborhood and desperately needing a pedi.  I didn't have an appointment and it was a Saturday so maybe that was my first mistake.  I walked in and the owner was at the desk.  He snapped at me to \"sign in!\"  I told him I already had and he just walked away.  I went over to pick my color and a few seconds later this woman was standing next to me asking me if I was ready.  I got the sense that she was very rushed so I just grabbed a color quickly off the shelf.  I told her to please not clip my cuticles and that I would like a flower on my toes.  The pedi went fine but again the flower she painted was horrible.  This was surprising since I figured getting a flower was safe.  I have gotten flowers there before and they turned out great.  Also once I got home and it had completely dried I noticed that there were air bubbles in the polish.  I was not happy with my pedi at all and probably could have done a better job at home.  I dealt with the owner once again when I went to pay and he didn't say two words to me.  Didn't smile, didn't tell me to have a nice day, nothing.  I said \"you have a good day\" and he looked up from his book and said \"What?!\" I repeated what I said and he just gave me a quick \"yeah you too\".   Normally he is very friendly so again I was shocked at this lack of customer service.  \n\nI guess the trick is it make an appointment and to be in your mid 40's.  They seem to cater to that age group and ignore the younger customers.  I'm in my mid 30's so it's not like I'm a teenager but I guess I look younger than I am because lately when I go in there I get the same poor treatment as the younger customers and sit there watching the \"older\" crowd and larger groups get all of the attention.\n\n  I honestly do not think I will be going here again based on the customer service and lack of quality I received.  I also don't appreciate being told that I have to pay in cash and told that I need to use the atm machine that they conveniently have located in their store.  \n\nOh and as for the rose petals and orange slices, they have really started skimping.  I got one tiny piece of orange (the end nub) and three rose petals.  That used to be another perk for me and unfortunately like everything else there it seems to have gone down hill.  \n\nWhat a shame, this used to be my favorite place :(","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":0}

The daily happy hour was eliminated. It's no longer a quiet hotel as they have a different clientele (they went from serving airline pilots and stewardesses to serving families with small children). My stay over the 4th of July weekend 2017 was inexcusable and travelers need to know. I brought a newly rescued puppy with me on the trip as they allow pets in the room for a fee. My puppy found a used razorblade and had it in her mouth. I called the front desk and was transferred to the Manager of the Day; on that day, it was Myra. She let me speak first. Then she said - I see in our records that you complained about noise last year. I was floored by her insensitivity. My complaint about noise in the past does not excuse how dirty the room was and my puppy could have died had she swallowed the used razor blade. She gave me 6,000 points. I called Corporate and they think 6,000 points is enough for the scare that gave me and potential death. This lack of empathy from customer service is appalling.

Three stars because the food & our server was okay, would've been two because of the overall atmosphere being weird and drastically different from how the restaurant first started out.\nThree years ago when I lived in Shadyside I would come here at least once a month. The atmosphere was fun, the \"Social Workers\" were very personable and cool, and the food really great, especially for a casual place. After moving a little further away I didn't come here as often but would still crave the turkey burger and tots. It had been worth the drive until now. There has been a change in management (per the server, as I had to ask). When we walked to the host stand nobody came around for like a few minutes. When we finally got a table a server didn't come around to take our beverage order for about ten minutes. We had to ask for the fill-in-your-own-salad-order sheet (probably not a big deal but this is kind of their main thing). After that everything was average. Our salads were okay. The server never checked back until we were done with our meals; I could've used more dressing for my salad because the chicken was dry. What was going on around us was bizarre too though. A party of four came in and asked for a specific table to which the host straight up said \"No\". It was not busy (8p on a Sat). There were a ton of open tables. They ended up being able to sit there but not til after a slight argument. Another party of four came in and legit had to wait for a table but what was weird was the host asked to see someone's ID even before they sat down! The guests were totally confused.

Then you try it and immediately realize that you still have much to learn in life.\n\nI've always been a big fan of LoLo's for many reasons. First, above all else, their fried chicken is top notch in terms of quality and consistency. In fact, their fried chicken is so good, that it beats out a handful of more upscale joints that shamefully charge more money for an inferior product. Make no mistake, Lolo's does chicken extremely well!\n\nThe waffles, on the other hand, are just okay. I'd describe them as soft and flimsy, with a slight cinnamon flavor to them. They're not quite as good as some of the waffles offered at local breakfast joints, but I suppose they're passable.\n\nI've tried several sides over the last few years, including grits, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. All are pretty well done and reasonably priced. Their menu, featuring various ghetto call-outs, is quite amusing, even though I'll probably never try most of the stuff myself. Their cornbread used to be my favorite of all the sides. It's still very good, but they recently changed the recipe that now includes actual corn kernels inside.

I have revisited Sakana on a business trip and now I am wondering if this is the same Sakana that I used to frequent...\nTo start with, the kind of sushi is certainly not the traditional sushi that you usually see in real Japanese restaurants. Real traditional Japanese restaurants offer smaller, well-cut and well-wrapped pieces \nwith a small amount of rice and high quality fish meat.  If I remember correctly the sushi in Sakana used to be like that 4-5 years ago.  \nNow the current Sakana offers huge slices of fish meat and huge amount of fish eggs but they may easily fall apart.   The quality and freshness are also mediocre at best, or to be more exact, close to the quality you find in all you can eat restaurants like Todai, Minado...,etc.\nThe rainbow roll that used to wow me is still the same price...but I am not sure if it is the same quality. The interior is certainly getting old and the carpet is really worn out.  All of which make it less and less attractive.  The best dish I had was the clam miso soup, but the sushi was really disappointing.  If you want \"volume\" at a more affordable price, I would recommend Todai or even Pacific. If you want \"real\" traditional Japanese sushi at an affordable price, I recommend Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale.  If you have a good amount of money to spend, you might as well spend it at Sushi On Shea, though you are really paying more for the atmosphere...

By the end of the night we were all just ready to leave and waited another 30 minutes to get the check so we could leave. We were there for about 3 hours and most of that time was spent waiting.

I have noticed a huge decline in their quality & even their service. 4 out of the last 5 times I ordered take out - my order was wrong. The quality of their curries has changed, less vegetables & meat and very watery. Satay appetizers, meat is not as tender as it used to be, cold rolls don't look fresh - bean sprouts are translucent and the flavor is just not there. Pad thai has no taste to it, they used to add a sufficient amount of sauce to the noodles. Used to be my favorite place to eat Thai food. At one point I thought maybe the ownership had changed - but it hasn't. Service & quality has changed and gone down in the last 5 years so much.

Great au jus for the prime rib and they offered both creamed and smooth horseradish on the side.  At around 4pm, they started switching to dinner and they had this bacon pork belly at the carving station as well.

Two of our group had this and I told the waiter it was tasteless and his response was that is was simply broiled and I said yes, we know that but it still tastes like nothing - literally, nothing.  He did not care at all, did not offer to change the dish or anything and my guests were entirely too polite to complain. The other guest ordered a filet mignon, pretty good tasting, but absolutely nothing else on the plate - just a lump of meat!  It was ridiculous.  They could have put something else, especially for prix-fixe, just anything, even a little frisee salad.\n\nThen at the end of the meal it was as if the server wanted to \"turn the table\" and did not offer any after dinner drinks, coffee or anything.  I asked him if anyone at my table wanted any coffee and he said no they did not.  I found out later that they were not even asked.\n\nI have since called the restaurant and I spoke with one of the managers who was somewhat apologetic and indicated that he would be speaking to the managing partner.

This Roberto's is always my first stop, regardless if I am hungry or not, regardless if I don't feel like eating mexican food, and regardless of what time it is.\n\nI usually get the two beef tacos combo, but I've had a lot of other items on their menu.  I love their bacon breakfast burritos.  It's not the best I've had, but it's pretty good. Overall, their food never disappoints.  It is always made fresh and the price of their food is reasonably priced.\n\nThe only complaint I have, and the only reason why I gave it a 4 star and not a 5, is because of their red salsa.  It used to be my favorite one, but when I came to visit in July of 2015, I noticed that their red salsa tasted very bland and it has some kind of \"plastic\" taste to it.  I thought, \"Okay, maybe they just made a bad batch...\" But as I came back in January and July of 2016 and 2017, I've noticed that it still has that same taste...it's not as good as it once was.

From the spooky themed scenes.\/actors, to the hayride, and the castle entryway, everything seemed to be just right. But this year, it was not as good as I remembered several years back. Let's start with cost: $12 for one attraction and $17 for both attractions (trail\/hayride). Groupon featured a pretty good deal where you and another person could attend one activity for $15 or 1 person could attend 2 attractions for $15 (With a Groupon coupon- $11). This is a complete STEAL! I think having deals\/coupons shows good customer service on the business' part, which is what brought me there! After all, these haunted attractions add up! By the time we got to the front of the line, I only had 2 Groupons and 3 other people to buy for so I ended up spending $18 a ticket. There was a random $1 service charge, as though $17 was not enough. I didn't like the extra charge or the confusion around the on site $3 off coupon. It is confusing as it states that it is valid Sunday and weekdays, excluding Fridays. We went on a Saturday night around 8 pm and the wait was 63 minutes. I think that is a pretty long wait considering they just opened 7pm. The overall atmosphere was the #1 thing I liked about the attraction- the music, the smell of the fire burning, the decor- it was completely Halloweeny! The live entertainment was good, it was nice that there were a couple bonfires, you could warm up with concession stand goodies, but there was little to no entertainment while waiting in line. The actors just stared at you. The hayride was spacious but the staff wanted you to sit on top of each other to make sure they could get enough people on the ride. I mean staff literally saw an open inch of space and made you move over until you were on top of each other. The haunted hayride was completely lack luster this year- poor acting, fast drive through and random unrelated scenes. There was a Wizard of Oz theme that I thought would be awesome but it made absolutely no sense. There was a lady holding a live rat which was entertaining, and a container overhead that looks like it will fall on you, but these were the only scenes I really liked. There were random decorations that you could look at while on ride, but not a whole lot of actors scaring you. The haunted trail was not spectacular, though it is spacious and out in the woods, which makes it fun. I don't like that after the hayride you have to wait in another line to get to the trail. Enough waiting already! They should figure out a better line waiting system\/waiting area. Overall, you will have a good time, but I have gone to much better haunted attractions this season!","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0}

A great space too.\n\nThe last time we went though was a major fail on the food. The drinks still held up strong (thus the 3 stars), but the crispy pig ears were soggy & super oily, and the raw fish smelled & tasted horrible. How could you serve unfresh fish raw? If you know the fish ain't good, don't offer it. Or change the menu and cook the fish so I can't tell that you're serving me fish you got last week. \n\nBecause of these bad dishes we were served (which was kind of embarrassing since I was the one who suggested to everyone we eat at Crudo), I don't think any of us want to go back.

My last trip, fish was slightly over cooked, and came in a small cup with the chips, I felt like for the price it should have been a plate, not a small cup. And the batter on the fish was overcooked.

This used to be my favorite bar in Las Vegas but I don't know if I will ever return after the ridiculously poor service we encountered last night. It was not packed and we got a great seat with an awesome view easily, but were then ignored by the cocktail waitress for a good 30 minutes, even as she served all of the tables around us. We decided to go to the bar, and it took another 15 minutes to finally get a drink in our hands -- a $14 vodka and ginger ale! I understand charging high prices for martinis and complicated concoctions, but soda with vodka? Oh my. We went back to our seat and when our drinks were empty, we were again ignored for a lengthy period by the waitress. We flagged her down and she was quite rude and said she would serve us but it was last call (this was around midnight and the bar was half full still). She brought us back our vodka and ginger ales but this time had charged $18 each. We asked why and she said she didn't know how to charge for ginger ale so she had made it up, and said she would fix it if we wanted. We had to point out the bartender who served us (there was only one guy working though, so what the???) so she could check out our story with him and find out how to charge for ginger ale.  She did fix the bill, but was pretty jerky about it. Then, at 12:30 the manager came around to all of the tables (about 10 tables full of people at this point) and politely asked us to leave so his staff could go home. (So it really isn't open until 2 every night as listed here on Yelp.) I guess we should be thankful that service was so painfully slow and snooty, because we would have bought several more rounds in the 3 hours we were there, spent a lot more money, probably would have come back again and spent even more money, would have recommended it to our friends who would have spent a bunch of their money, too.

I even managed to get a group of 15 high school kids go to Sushi Ken for their homecoming dance dinner when I was in high school 6 years ago (which isn't a small feat, if you consider all the traditional high-school-dance-dinner-venues). Probably visited at least twice a week, when I lived in the Ahwatukee area.\n\n...What happened? It pains me to only give Sushi Ken a one-star rating, it really does, because half a decade ago I would have recommended them to the President of the United States. For some reason, not only has the food quality diminished in the past few years, the portions have undoubtedly shrunken, and the prices have inflated. Which still isn't the worst part.\n\nI have absolutely nothing good to say about the service. No matter how good a restaurant's food is, if the service cant support the product, it's not worth eating at all. \n\nSushi Ken is not a friendly atmosphere. Water cups are never refilled. Food takes the entire Paleolithic era to be delivered. The servers used to be flexible with the menu and accommodated for substitution requests; however, now there is a ridiculous 20% upcharge to substitute salmon for tuna. The waitresses make you feel like they hate you and that they dread serving you, no matter how kind you are to them. Perhaps it's because they've implemented a 15% autogratuity policy, regardless of how large the party is, so they can get away with poor service without having to take a cut in profit. It's absolutely ridiculous. The queen of evil servers (the tallish Asian one who never smiles, only scowls), spilled water on my dad one time without so much as an apology. A few weeks later, as she was serving ramen to one of my girlfriends, she spilled half the broth on the tray and completely ignored her mistake. \n\nSo I thought I would find a way to bypass the horrible service while still enjoying a Sushi Ken lunch - call in for a takeout order and control my own service in the comfort of my home. I called in for a ramen, and requested that they separate the noodles from the broth in order to avoid them getting soggy (which is the standard for noodle packaging, right?) WRONG. Fifty cent up-charge. OUTRAGEOUS. Now, I get that you're trying to scrimp and save marginal costs, but really? Sacrificing the satisfaction and loyalty of a customer as well as food quality in order to save ONE to-go container that cost maybe fifteen cents max? Bad idea.   \n\nCome on, people, you're in the service industry. You're paid to serve. It's not that hard of a job - you smile and greet your patrons, who don't expect much in the first place - all they want is good food (which you have), and an atmosphere that doesn't make the table feel like their server's  going to pounce and maul their faces off. \n\nNews flash, Sushi Ken - tips are earned, not obligatory. I once served at a restaurant where autogratuity was forbidden, because management believed that excellent service speaks for itself. If you had to implement an autograt to every single party, big or small, then chances are you KNOW that your Service. Flat. Out. Sucks. People aren't happy to be treated like scum, then forced to pay for it. The solution is simple - revamp your service training protocol, and you'll get your loyal customers back.\n\nTo my fellow Yelpers: Avoid at all costs. I'm telling you, boycott this restaurant, and hopefully they'll shape up in the future. Because if not, there's no way Sushi Ken will stay alive in the long run.","useful":11,"funny":2,"cool":2}

However, during games they no longer offer many specials and they don't have giveaways, so there isn't much of a crowd. Upstairs they've also ripped out all of the video poker machines and made it totally non smoking (which is good, IMO).\n\nThey no longer offer crab nachos, which was one of the best things on the menu. And most popular. There are also small changes, like not putting a shrimp in your bloody mary anymore.\n\nUpstairs used to be my favorite place, now I feel like they are doing everything they can to shut this place down.

Its a natural pain of growing a business, as more management, more staff and more processes make it harder to keep the store exactly how it was when it first got started. This is kinda how I feel Pita Jungle has gotten. I no longer have the same level of experience every time, at the same place nor comparing different locations. \n\nAt this particular location, I have tried a couple of things during multiple visits. I really enjoyed their curry coconut soup at lunch: it was pretty thin\/light and had a lot of Thai flavors (and the cup version was filling enough). Their grilled veggie salad was huge and a great concept, but their eggplant was under cooked and under seasoned, and since the veggies are already grilled in oil, the added dressing with oil made it a bit heavy. \n\nSpeaking of oil. I used to LOVE love love their side of cauliflower with tahini sauce and caramelized onions. I would come to the Pita Jungle in Gilbert just to order that and nom it for dinner. The past couple of times I have ordered this dish, I have ended up with incredible stomach pain (like my intestines playing in the French Open)... every single time, immediately after. I'm starting to think that its the oil content in the tahini, or something that they might have changed in the recipe to make it more cost effective. Either way, its a painful dish, and it makes me sick every time. It used to be my favorite thing on the menu :(\n\nIn terms of service, its very much dependent on how busy it is.

We go to a bar to waste time and 45mins later we receive a text so we return. Once we are seated a woman who said she was part owner tells us that the restaurant is \"very busy tonight and you'll need to be done within a hour\" and she continues to tell us about the table of 14 that's eating and it being a small kitchen. Mind you they weren't slammed. Our waiter takes our order (still no drinks) and it took so long that we had to ask him after 45 mins where it was. We're now sarcastically thinking, \"Well does the hour start now since we received our food or what?\" We then ask to speak to the manager about the lack of service and the lady comes back over!!!

My all-time favorite is the $18, eggs potato cheese. VERY GOOD. this is my standard for breakfast burritos everywhere else I go.\n\nThe only reason I give this place a 4-star is because recently the salsa has been very inconsistent. One day I went and the salsa was extremely watery and gross. The chips are consistently gross, but what good is that without amazing salsa. They moved like 20 feet, and the new place is much nicer, but the food quality has gone down a bit. Last night my GF and I went close to closing time, and we didn't get very good food. The steak was more like barbacoa, and the potatoes were more like mashed potatoes (we got a steak potato cheese for my GF). Not very appealing.\n\nThis place used to be a staple for me, and I wouldn't think twice about going there. But recently, I don't know what has happened. The old lady that works there is very nice, but I just don't know what is going on to what used to be my favorite non-chain mexican food place in phoenix.\n\n*sigh* I hope they find their consistency again.

I didn't have problems with my pillows, but some other people we were staying with did. I felt them for myself, they were hard as concrete. The closets? What were they thinking! The bar goes horizontal so you can't see what you have hung up. On one side, they put a safe on a shelf right below it, so you can't even hang anything up. Who designed this?\n\nThere are a FEW pluses that keep this from being one star. The bathroom. It hasn't changed except for the wall paper and the lighting and the brand of bath products. They have the most awesome, deep, bathtub with a waterfall spout. My favorite thing to do is to get some products from LUSH in the MB shops and soak in the bath while watching TV. They have also upgraded the TV to look more like what you would have at home, HD and a guide to look at instead of just channel numbers. Definitely an improvement there.\n\nThe cost of room service has tripled. We ordered dessert; a peach crumble a la mode and an ice cream. $37 WITHOUT tip! For the side of ice cream, they brought us up an entire pint. What a waste. Not to mention is took an hour and a half to get to us. Good thing we weren't waiting on dinner.\n\nThey also tried to charge me with 2 mini bar items that I never even touched. We didn't have housekeeping the entire 3 days we were there, so even if we DID partake in the overpriced items they stock in there, there was no way they could of known until after we checked out.\n\nI understand that the hotel is in transition phase.

She then Starts talking loudly about fungus and how if she didn't take all my nails off  I would get fungus....? ( doesn't make sense) Now by this point everyone is looking at me disgusted because she's yelling the word fungus at me. I'm trying to calm down the situation and say \"OK no full set let's just take them all off and I'll come back later\". She didn't like that answer and started getting upset with me that I wouldn't do the full set right now. She then asks \"what... You don't have money for a full set\" which was completely loud and I was SO mortified. By this point she is now speaking in her  native language to everyone alerting them about the situation and laughing.  I seriously felt as if i couldn't get out of there fast enough. How embarrassing and how rude of Michelle to do something like that.  Hands-down worst nail tech ever and I will never use this nail salon again!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It used to be my favorite steakhouse in all of LV, but it has gone so far downhill i'll never eat here again.\n\nIt was our servers first day, and I'm more than willing to cut a new server some slack, but what happened was ridiculous.\n\nFor entree I ordered the filet which was cooked well but tastes nowhere near what their steaks tasted like 2 years ago when I frequently ate there.  \n\nI asked the waiter to add a lobster TAIL to the steak.\n\nWhen the food came out, the waiter brought our steaks, and a WHOLE lobster.  I asked another server to get ours because we ordered a tail and not the whole lobster.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later our server came over and tried to tell me that what was on the table WAS a lobster tail. \n\nFunny - i've never seen a lobster tail with claws, legs, and a body before.\n\nMy friend and I were already into our steaks when he took the whole lobster away and said he would look into it.\n\n15 mins later he comes back - still no lobster tail, and I was almost done with my steak and we were in a rush so I told him to just forget the tail if it was gonna take longer.\n\nThen he disappears for another 15 mins.  I asked another server to please grab him and he came out and I asked for the check.\n\nAnother 10 minutes goes by and so we walked in to see if the check was ready and what was taking so long. (we ate outside)\n\nThe manager was adjusting the bill - and this is what REALLY pissed me off.\n\nThe manager says \"since you ordered the whole lobster and then cancelled it and then ordered the tail and then cancelled it Im charging you for the tail.\n\nI said - \"No - I ordered just a tail to begin with\"  \n\nHe says \"No you didn't my server told me you ordered the whole lobster.  I trust my server\"\n\nAnd wanted to stand there and argue with me about it telling me I was lying about ordering just the lobster tail.\n\nI told him I was almost done with my meal and the tail still wasn't there which was why I cancelled it.\n\nHe didn't want to hear any of it, and got a really smug attitude with me.\n\nAt no other nice restaurant on the Vegas  strip will you see this sort of treatment of a customer.  He stood there blatantly calling me a liar right to my face, when both my friend and I tried to tell him the server was the one who fucked up.  Not me.\n\nThis place went from penthouse to outhouse.  From the management, to the wait staff, to the food.\n\n I'll never eat here again.","useful":12,"funny":4,"cool":2}

A few years ago I stopped coming here because they actually sent out Taquitos instead of the regular dish and I was quite disappointed with this change but they seem to be back to normal now.\n\nOne thing is consistent, the service.

On three previous occasions at the new location it would seem customer service has gone completely out the window.    \n\nThe first visit I stood at the counter for over half an hour before anybody even came to help me.  There were only two shooters on the range and two sales people at the counter, it wasn't even that busy. When finally it was my turn to get checked in I had questions about that interactive range at the end but the guy didn't know enough about it to answer my questions and I didn't want to wait longer for someone else.  I did actually get to shoot that day so that's something.\n\nThe second time I went in I stood at the counter for twenty minutes before someone finally came over to tell me that if I wanted to shoot there was over an hour wait.  There range wasn't even full but who knows.  \n\nThe third time I went to the new location I was refused a range 50 minutes before closing time because it was almost closing time. I arrived at 6 I waited at the counter for 10 minutes only to be told it was too close to closing time which is at 7.   I had just gotten out of work, when else am I supposed to come and practice.\n\nI left there that day swearing to never go back.  I went down the street to the Gun and Ammo Garage who at 6:30 told me YES of course you can shoot until we close.  I have been going there ever since, a little over a year now.  Little small range yet they had six people working, two at sales counter, two at a check-in and two range attendants and a girl cleaning up so 7.  \n\nYesterday, I went to range only to find out my favorite range...the Gun Garage had closed.  So I went back to the Range 702 because it is the closest one.  Same shit a year and a half later.  One girl working the \"machine gun\" counter standing around with nothing to do, very nice girl actually said hello when I came in.  I asked her if I could check-in with her but she said I had to go to the other counter if I just wanted a range time.  Two guys working the counter both helping people, I get that, what I don't get is them not being able to say hello, OR I'll be right with you, OR let me call someone else to help you.  I would understand even more if they actually had guns out of the counter showing them to people...they did not.\n\nAs I am standing at the end of the counter a range guy comes out, walks right past me to get behind the counter.  Looks right at me says nothing, not hello, not is anybody helping you ...nothing.  He's there for a minute or two, does something on the computer and leaves.  I've been there about seven minutes at that point, I gave it three more and then left.  \n\nI get it it's Tuesday, I'm a girl, probably just coming in for that free range time.  All true...however,  I'm also a girl looling to buy a new 9mm.   I left and I went a few blocks over to American Shooters, who had like 15 people working.  Several people greeted me when I walked In, two stopped to help me and chat before directing me to the Range with instructions on how to sign in, plenty of people working here and all friendly, all helpful, very busy store and range...I only waited a couple minutes to check in.\n\nWhile I came for the free ladies range time...I also rented a Glock 19, and bought ammo and targets.  Next week I'll go back and rent something else, and I'll keep renting different guns until I find one I like.  And then I'll buy a new one. \n\nBut I'll tell you where I won't be buying it...Range 702.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

The tacos are large and served either in soft or hard shells with your choice of the typical fillings and toppings. No complaints here. The flautas used to be my favorite but here they aren't as good as I remembered. I think part of the problem is that they were very sparse with the toppings, such as lettuce, onions, etc. What little there was was under the flautas instead of on top, so the heat (and grease) kind of wilted everything. The tostadas were the same way, with very little in the way of toppings. The chips and salsa are outstanding, to the point of it's worth getting an extra order just to take home with you. Don't get me wrong, what food I did get tasted great but just not exactly as great as I'd hoped.  \n\nService is fast once you order. You order at a counter and then they bring it to you. The order takers have been very friendly and accommodating to any order modifications each time I've been. Here's a hint...if you're a teacher, military, police or fire, you get a 10% discount.\n\nI almost forgot the hot sauce bar.

Just make sure you know which night to come out to this place, look to see if there is a visiting DJ to ensure that you aren't in a room with 15 other people awkwardly swaying back and forth.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Its authentic Sichuan Chinese food has drawn so many people to its wonderful central location at State and Gilman. I at least have dined more than 10 times during 2009-2010 and have been constantly happy with its food. Back then, only Wah Kee Noodle was the other \"Authentic\" Chinese place on my radar. \n\nBut you know, restaurants are precarious business. \n\nSince 2009, there has been a revolution in the Chinese food scene in Madison. I can count almost 10 new authentic Chinese restaurants joining the competition. Ichiban, Oriental House, Double 10, Dumpling Haus, Hong Kong Station, to name a few. Fugu was no longer unique, and I have settled with Ichiban for Sichuan food in the past couple of years. \n\nEarlier this week, I went back to Fugu and was totally disappointed. The dining space was under-staffed with only two people handling 50 people. Through the whole time of our dinner, servers never had time to clean up dirty dishes left by previous customers. When we left, the restaurant was full of empty tables with dirty dishes. A group of people came but was unable to be seated. So they left. It was ugly. Plus, there were flies accompanying our dinner. \n\nWe had 5 dishes, but they slowly came during a 30-mins period. The fast and accurate service was gone. \n\nFood was good but inconsistent. Water-boiled beef and Tofu Fish were really good, but somehow our stirred fried pea shoot, the easiest and overpriced dish of all, was messed up. Too much salt. \n\nMy experience sounds really bad, but I tend to think it was an anomaly rather than the standard. Therefore I gave it a 3 star instead of 2.

Oddly enough, it's also the stuff that is easiest to fix.

This should never be an issue with a sushi restaurant.  Never. Sure, AYCE places get really busy and I totally understand that. But, if you can't handle the heat - hire more servers. \n\nI shouldn't have to wait more than 45 minutes for my order. And when my order does come out, half of it shouldn't be missing. It also shouldn't take you another 30 minutes to bring out the pieces missing from my order. And you shouldn't have an attitude with customers just because they are asking for the items they originally ordered that are missing because you either forgot to put the orders in or there was a mix up in the kitchen. I am never rude to waiters or management and this last experience at Oyshi was no exception.

Now usually you would expect the appetizer to arrive prior to the meal correct? WRONG. We received everything at once...another big pet peeve. The food did not take long to arrive which is THE SOUL reason for the 2 stars otherwise I would have given .5 stars if possible. The server checked on us once and I asked for spicy sauce....I never received it so another gentlemen brought it 20 minutes later when I was done with the meal. We are currently waiting for our server to show up so we can ask for boxes. It's been 15 minutes and counting of said waiting....NEVER COMING BACK! RIP Koji...","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Love their red velvet cake and ordered one 24 hours in advance for my birthday. We came it pick it up 20 mins after they were supposed to have it ready, to find out the bakers never got the order. Was told it would be ready in 5 mins by one staff member, so we waited 10. Only then to be told by the actual baker that it would take at least an hour. He was apologetic and said since we couldn't pick up the cake until after my party (since I wasn't going to leave my own birthday party to come back a second time) was told there would be no charge. So one of my guests picked up a second cake at another bakery just so I would have one. When I came back to Lolo's, the cake was ready, and I asked if the $90 I already paid for it when I placed the order the day before was credited as I was told earlier in the day that it would be. After waiting 12 minutes for the manager to check on it, I was told I was wrong, no one told me it would be free, and they'll only credit me $20. After explaining my situation, and that the cake we had to buy to replace the one they didn't have ready in time was almost $50, that I would be fine if they credited me that amount instead of the whole $90. By the time the manager was done arguing with me, I was furious. And after we finally agreed on a 50% discount for dealing with all of their mistakes and misinformation, he even shorted me $5 when he credited back my card! All in all I spent almost an hour in two separate visits on my birthday and ended up having to argue with a senior staff member just to pick up a cake I had ordered a whole day in advance while getting less than half the credit I was promised. \n\nAnd the cake wasn't even as good as I remembered!!!!\n\nTotal fail, will avoid like the plague and tell everyone I ever hear mention Lolo's name that there are much, MUCH better soul food restaurants in town where you don't walk out of there feeling like you want to punch everyone who works there.","useful":10,"funny":0,"cool":0}

He said that the boss has changed the days, and nowit  is Tuesday through Thursday. He told me you have to buy it, I said ok I will, but my phone was having problems with groupon's website. Also they used to have lunch specials, I asked the waiter about those specials, and he told me that people order for the menu, not lunch specials. I think that the waiter has a bad attitude, because we had a problem with him at a similar restaurant. At the end he said here is your bill, and here is the space for my tip, our bill was $55 and I tip him $5 for his bad customer service.

Literally the bluing on the top half of the pistol and the beavertail came back purple instead of matte black like the rest of the pistol.  Then the gunsmith there gave me attitude when I questioned them about it and said that's the risk of doing custom work like that.  It also would misfeed fairly often I found out after shooting it for a while, which at first I attributed to the ammo I was using.  Needless to say I wasn't happy, so much so I never used what used to be my favorite pistol the next couple years.  I was down at C2 and got introduced to Brian at Wright Armory, had him take a look at it and get this - the purplish color was because the previous guys didn't heat the gun up to a high enough temperature to turn it black.  It also turned out the other guys didn't correctly install the ambi safety either.  Brian fixed both of those issues, did a reliability job (had to after the last place had it!) and trigger job and now the gun shoots unbelievably and is back to being my favorite gun to shoot.

We were told it is because they were wasting so much...here's an idea, plan better with the old bread selection instead of offering up a boring bread.\n\nA couple months ago, the bread selection had dwindled, last night we were surprised at how the menu dwindled.\n\nThe selections were awful. They no longer have spicy salads, different sauce selections with a fish menu.  So we tried to embrace it by ordering something new.  I ordered the fish tacos.  They were awful. Their \"southwestern\" cooking style was some sort of pickling of peppers.  Not a good combination!  I ate one, just trying to identify the taste.  My husband had one and couldn't even stomach half of it! They also were wrapped in two corn tortillas for each taco...overkill! We couldn't even eat the third taco.\n\nMy husband ordered some sort of ranch style salad with 3 shrimp that were cold, being served in some tiny little skillet. Think the skillet was for looks since the shrimp was cold. He said there wasn't any flavor to the salad. It was very boring.\n\nOur young daughter ordered off the child's menu and had a steak, mashed potatoes,  broccoli & a tiny cup of fruit. Everything she had tasted pretty good, except the steak was incredibly salty. Way too much salt for a kid and for me. My husband thought the steak was ok.\n\nI am also going to mention the overall ambiance. It was so incredibly loud! Not sure what happened when they remodeled, but we used to be able to talk across the table and hear one another. Now it is so noisy, you have to speak loudly just to have a conversation and good luck hearing what your companion has to say.   \n\nSomething on the menus stunk really badly too! Not sure if it was the wood they used or some sort of lacquer,  but it was awful. \n\nThe wood in the restaurant also smelled of stain or lacquer.  Not sure what product they used, but the place needs to be aired out for a couple months so it doesn't stink so much.\n\nThe only change this restaurant did that deserved a star was change their prices. They are lower. My meal used to run $28 just for my entree. Since it is no longer available, I tried nasty fish tacos for $15.  So it appears they have reduced their prices.

Unfortunately, my take out order has yet again been messed up. The first time it was messed up, my burrito supreme was a tiny chicken burrito with a side of beans and rice. The burrito supreme is half chicken and half beef with an awesome ranchero sauce on top and a side of rice. Last night my burrito supreme was a tiny half beef and half chicken burrito with sides of beans and rice. I called them, they said they'd fix it if I brought back the incorrect food. It's nearby, not a huge deal. I bring it all back, but stupidly don't check on my way out with the correct food. My salsa order is missing. I just gave up because I wasn't going back again and I should've looked harder. I was mostly inspecting the burrito. The ground beef lacks flavor without the ranchero sauce, so when it's missing it's noticeable. \n\nTheir service used to be impeccable and the food always delicious.

With my latest experience that has all changed.  I brought in my engagement ring to get a small diamond in the band part replaced that had been lost.  This is a fairly standard sub $100 service that jewelers provide.  As expected, Helzberg took the job and said they'd have it back in a week.  No problem initially.  Upon coming back in to pick it up, the replaced diamond was extremely obvious and the ring was no longer round.  Completely obvious mistakes, visible to the naked eye.  Upon a comment they agreed to take it back (though it wasn't the friendliest exchange).  Guess what? I come back to pick it up, and again the new small diamond is uneven with the rest in the line, at least the ring is the right shape this time.  Upon a discussion I was told \"that's not the diamond we replaced\".  Are you **** kidding?  To lie directly to my face is unforgivable.  I commented as such and the manager came out.  This is really when the shocking part begins.  After a 10 minute wait and a clearly visible discussion with the jeweler in the back (whom I'm apparently not allowed to speak to directly) she comes out and tells me again that the diamond I'm pointing out isn't the one they fixed.  I even found the documentation that they wrote up where it clearly showed the diamond that is still wrong being the one that they claim to have worked on.  Even after agreeing to take it back, they never agreed that this is the diamond they were working on.  I should have just taken the ring back at that point (clearly), but I still had some hope they could redeem themselves.  A week later, I come back to get the ring and its finally mostly fixed.  But the new diamond mount still has a sharp edge that can catch on clothing, its bound to get loose and end up loosing the same one again.  In addition, the platinum is discolored where they put heat to it.  This is the least professional work I have ever seen with some of the worst customer service.  I gave up and decided to take it (to get it fixed elsewhere).  Upon exit, the manager informed me that the original manufacturer actually will replace diamonds for free.  That would have been good to know at the beginning.  A real craftsman who doesn't think they can do a good job would inform you of this up front and offer to help you find the best solution, a dishonest one makes it sound like it is the customer's fault for even bringing the item to this store in the first place when clearly you should just go back to the manufacturer (which I will clearly do next time).\n\nI really did like Helzberg, but now I will never be back (at least not to this location).  If this is what can be expected from Helzberg, Berkshire Hathaway should seriously consider divesting, in the long run, dishonest businesses aren't profitable.  And in this case, the manager choose too fire a long time customer over a $100 service over issues that could have easily been avoided.  Is a customer worth that little? Do some 2nd grade math and you can figure out that keeping a customer at a high margin jewelry store is worth way more than a mere $100.\n\nWarning to all Yelpers...never buy anything here or contract any service.  Follow this simple rule, if you ever feel pressured, trapped or scared while buying anything, DON'T BUY IT and leave immediately.  In this store, you're bound to feel all of these emotions at some point.\n\nTo all Men looking for engagement rings, shop around and find something you really like, do your research, and get more for your money.  You'll be glad you did (my husband sure is glad we didn't buy from here in the first place and so am I).","useful":6,"funny":2,"cool":1}

We sat on the patio, every table was dirty and no one ever came outside to clean up while we were there.

I requested a table for 4 outdoors with an extra chair. The hostess told me immediately she was not able to to bring me an extra chair. When asked why- she stated this is the \"policy\" of the restaurant. I asked to speak with a manager. The female \"manager\" on duty that evening, also in the same robotically trained tone, told me the same thing. You see, 4 months ago I almost lost my leg in a car accident when a man hit me and pinned me between two cars. I cannot sit for extended periods of time without being able to elevate my leg. I am just starting to be able to leave the house and this was a special occasion among friends for me to be able to get out for the evening. This female manager was extremely rude and kept repeating herself they would not \"inconvenience\" other guests and it was their policy to not allow an extra chair at my table, even though I am disabled and have special handicap passes provided to me by the government. When asked, she clearly stated it was the owner's policy to not allow this extra chair assistance. As you can see from my photographs, during our dinner- there were plenty of tables open from which an extra chair could have been borrowed and utilized until the restaurant was so packed, not one chair could be spared. Our table was in the back and completely out of any space that an extra chair would have been a fire hazard, gotten in any guests way or even a servers path. In my 20 years of restaurant experience, I would NEVER deny a person in special need of ANYTHING to make their intentional visit to my restaurant as comfortable as possible. Several guests could see my discomfort throughout our dinner and offered me the extra chair from their table, but the server was told to watch my table and not to allow it- and I had to politely decline as I didn't want my entire parties night to be ruined. I have never been made to feel so policed and so discarded as I was this evening at Diego Pops. I will NEVER return to this establishment, and I will NEVER send any more friends here either. It's quite a shame as I have been coming since it opened and it's become a favorite hot spot for my friends and family and I to dine.  I am Vegan and so is my boyfriend and because of the plantain tacos and vegan rice and beans options, it's a great pick for us. Anyway, I am absolutely disgusted by the complete and utter disregard by this staff and so called manager for my special needs and rights. This behavior is not only illegal, but really just quite disgusting in general.

But now I'm a local and also a vegetarian, so I really don't eat at the buffets except when friends are in town.  Well wouldn't you know it, we had some friends in town recently and they wanted to go to Spice Market Buffet.  I honestly was pretty excited because I now had an excuse to come back.\n\nSo I don't know if I'm jaded as a local or if it's because my choices are severely limited since I can't eat 95% of the items, but I'm never really impressed with buffets anymore.  Spice Market, however, is still pretty good option in my option.  My friends (non-vegetarians) were happy with their meal.\n\nAs any vegetarian in Vegas knows, your choices at a buffet are very starch- and dairy-heavy, and Spice Market is no exception.  I had quesadillas, pasta with pesto sauce, mac 'n cheese, and whipped potatoes.  They did offer simple green beans and even some really yummy roasted veggies (asparagus, zucchini, onions) in the Italian section.  The Middle Eastern section has several veg-friendly choices, but be weary of the Moroccan vegetables- they had really bad seasoning and texture.  I enjoyed the desserts, but then again, I always enjoy the desserts.  The fruit tarts and cream puffs were my favorite.\n\nOther things you can expect include: shrimp, soups, breadsticks, pizza, fajitas, several breads and spreads, sweet potatoes, cotton candy, and a dessert crepe station.\n\nI think this is still a solid buffet, especially as a tourist.  The prices are reasonable (for a buffet on The Strip) and I even found a coupon online for $5 off (http:\/\/www.destinationcoupons.com\/Nevada\/Las_Vegas\/spice-market-buffet\/spice-market-buffet-coupons.asp).  Vegetarians, you can find enough to eat here (including a decent salad bar that I didn't even touch).  Vegans, I would say you need to avoid all buffets (too much dairy).  Everyone else, there are tons of choices including prime rib and crab legs- you will leave stuffed.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":1}

This used to be my favorite spa in Vegas, and I have been to nearly all of them multiple times.  I was looking forward to returning, but was amazed at the disrepair.  There are probably nearly 50 tiles missing from the hot tub.  What is that sharp, pokey thing under my foot?  Why, it's a loose tile that I then fished out.  I would have loved to take a picture of the all the missing tiles in the two in-tub lounge seats, but no photos in the spa.  Perhaps they are counting on that.\n\nHere is another fun game.  Go into the Igloo (cold room) and look behind the frosted glass covering the lights on the wall.  That is black mold growing that you are inhaling when you are enjoying your cool down.\n\nAnd they still are charging $175 for a 50 minute massage.  All the price, but they have given up on the facilities.  Brow wax is done in the noisy salon with a lady that was rushing the process as fast as possible (taking the mirror from my hand as I am looking at my new brows?!? am I that slow?!?)\n\nCheck out was slow, when I was assured that my bill would be ready to sign when I left.  And no one asked how many experience was - otherwise, I would have gladly explained my lacking experience.\n\nThe bright spot was my massage (hence, the 2nd star).

The manager was really nice and said he would give me $10 the next time I came in.\nToday I took my mother to Garcias and remembered I had the $10 off to use. When the waiter came by I tried to explain about the $10 off, and he started saying I need to give him the coupon when I ordered my food and I will have to speak with the manager. I didn't physically have a coupon to give to the waiter, it was offered to me over the phone. I saw the waiter go into the kitchen and was telling someone about this \"coupon\" but I didn't see who he was talking too. A little while later a manager 'Eric' came over to our table looking as if I was some kind of inconvenience to him. He said, \"you wanted to see the manager.\" As I was explaining to him the situation he just shrugged his shoulders as if to say So? This manager totally made me feel as though I was trying to get food for free! He said well if it's true it will be in our book. I was so mad! I told him you know what go and check your book, if it's not in there I will gladly pay the bill, but I will never be back! \nThe manager returned and said it was in the book, you get $10 off, your bill is $10.50.

Two years ago this would be five stars all day,  The three stars are purely from nostalgia. \n\ni used have lunch at the bar often but due to a new job I don't have time so I have resorted to ordering togo for the last year.  As i have not eaten in house for some time this review wont speak to that experience.  I normally get the chicken pasta or the tenderloin salad... both of which used to be my favorite things ever.  The bread here is also amazing... hands down amazing.  This is where it goes down hill.  I've noticed that the portions of the pasta has gotten much smaller but the price has increased. As far as the salad its been three times in a row that the steak on my tenderloin salad has been far overcooked.  Extremely disappointed.\n\nAs for the bread... when you sit down and eat you can have as much bread as you want ... without any charge... when you get take out you will most likely receive a loaf of bread 2 hours old but if you ask for an extra you will be charged for it.   I can see this happening at olive garden but when you are paying 17 dollars for a salad I would think an extra bread would be included... not the case.  \n\nThis restaurant used to be the best place to eat on the west side... its a bit expensive but it was well worth it.  Off principal alone I will not be eating here anymore.  Increase the prices, cut down the portions on food and start gorging customers on little things like bread that are accounted for in the price of the entrees already..... great business model.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Bellagio Buffet used to be my favorite buffet for many years... until now. I had gone to their weekend brunch buffet multiple times from 2000-2004 and it was awesome every time. However, I went there today and for the hefty price and compared to previous times, it was a disappointment.\n\nWe got there around 11:30am and there was still a crazy line as it used to have. We waited about 40 min in line before we got seated. I believe if you are staying at Bellagio, you can walk up to the VIP line and skip much of the long wait. The place itself is big, clean, and nice consistent with the style of the Bellagio.  The weekend brunch buffet was $23.95 pp without champagne and $28.95 with champagne.  There are also different prices for the weekend gourmet dinner and weekday lunch and dinner prices.\n\nSample of brunch buffet options offered:\n- breakfast foods (pancakes, waffles, sausage, eggs, eggs benedict, croissants, made-to-order omlettes, etc.)\n- asian (singapore noodles, bok choy, congee, curry with duck, sweet and sour chicken, hot and sour soup, etc)\n- sushi (a limited selection of cali rolls, veggie rolls, spicy tuna handrolls that you can ask the lady in the back to made - but wasn't so great, seaweed salad, etc)\n- seafood (fresh gulf shrimp w\/cocktail sauce - pretty good, grouper, halibut, salmon, etc)\n- Italian (a couple different pastas)\n- carving station (prime rib, lamb, turkey, chicken wellington - all not that tasty and some overcooked)\n- desserts (soft serve ice cream, carrot cake, eclairs, cream puffs, etc.) - none all too exciting\n- salads (variety)\n- breads and soups\n\nThere was a wide selection of weekend brunch buffet food but none this time that wowed me. They used to have the most amazing and buttery seabass that melted in your mouth. But none this time - only some slightly overcooked halibut, salmon, and grouper. They used to have juicy, tender, and large pieces of prime rib - but today it was small, rather overcooked and not as flavorful. They used to offer various cheeses with bread but apparently they have cutback on that too. They used to have lots of delicious scones which they don't offer anymore.  There was nothing I ate today that wow'ed me and made me want to stuff one more last bite because it was that good. \n\nBottom line: Overall still a good buffet but it seems to be a lot more ordinary now and may not be worth the $23.95 price compared to other available buffet options. I think they have definitely skimped from what it was in the past. If you have to pay ~$25 for a weekend brunch buffet, I'd rather go to the Spice Market buffet in the Planet Hollwood casino (which was great) or maybe check out the Wynn Buffer (have not tried that yet). And you may not have to wait in the ridiculous line.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

There are still some older regulars and the occasional slip of the under-ager, but it doesn't effect us. There is a jukebox, pool table, and dart board if you get bored with the video poker machines, and the bartenders are always friendly. The food is decent, and there is a cozy dining room to sit in as well. Red Hawk is a nice bar (now) for a casual drink or game of pool if you're bored on a weekday night.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Anyways, more about Leticia's: the food is eclectic; however sometimes the basic ingredient of salt is missed and the food comes out a bit bland. The flavor aspect, especially from a Mexican restaurant is missing. Additionally, the prices are pretty exorbitantly high for the quality of taste that has dwindled over the years. Their Happy Hour makes me want to cry, *whispers* It's expensive, too! Honestly, I have come to the conclusion that Leticia's survives as well as it does partly because of it's location. It sits in an upper middle class neighborhood within the upper middle class part of NW Vegas. It's also the most authentic Mexican restaurant for miles---of anyone says Lindo Michoacan is authentic, I'm going to remind them of their cheesy and stereotypical atmosphere, their bland food and their salsa that tastes like a rip off of Heinz Ketchup. Also, I think Leticia's survives so well is also because of their puffy tacos and green salsa; yes, I'm dead serious. They have this amazing green citrusy\/avocado salsa that craves the attention of most pregnant women, tacos lovers and salsa fanatics. Anyways, Leticia's will always have a place in my heart, especially because I live 2 minutes away not the NW Valley , but I will now drive 40 minutes to Juan's for my Mexican food infatuation","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This used to be my favorite part about visiting Scottsdale's Mall. We purchased a dozen cookies and a cinnamon role yesterday from a rude woman with no patience or communication skills. The cookies were DRY and disgusting like the ones you usually find at Panera, nothing like they used to be at the real Paradise Bakery. The best part was the crappy variety, whereas you used to have about 8 or more cookie choices at paradise. I was told to pick from just one tray of Dry brittle cookies that resembled their former selves but only visually. This place makes me sad, and I won't be back until Panera stops ruining it with its dry corporate bland ways.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The hostess was wrong.\nI was sitting on patio and then I entered the house to use the bathroom.\nShe didnot see me as I was sitting outside. So she told me I was NOT allowed to use the bathroom upstairs unless I was having dinner here.\nIf this has always been your bathroom policy, then I suggest u change it to welcome potential guests, after all, it is not likely for someone who is not a local to find a bathroom in this neighborhood.\nIf your bathroom policy has not always been guests only, then I suggest you fire the racist hostess because she apparently told me (after I repeatedly ask her if she was serious) such policy only because I am Asian.","useful":0,"funny":3,"cool":0}

When we asked to correct them, it took more than one try and more than one phone call. Because of this when my sister tried to charge something to the room, she was treated like a thief. When my sister's key card demagnitized, they gave her a new one but then canceled my key card as well without telling her. It then took over 45 minutes to get security to get me in my room which was a really problem because I was there for work at a convention. I missed part of an important meeting as a result. \n\nThey also charged us for an upgrade they didn't give us. I had to call to get credit for the mistake and that phone call took more than 30 minutes. \n\nThe service at the Grand Luxe in Palazzo side was terrible. It was slow and the waitress couldn't even get the drink order right. \n\nI completed the customer survey and received an email from Theresa Miranda in customer relations to apologize. She also offered to help with any future stay because of our experience so I thought, what the heck, we were planning to go back for my birthday that is coming up so asked for some rates. It's now been a week and she hasn't responded. \n\nI would think twice about calling this place a four star or five star hotel anymore.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I understand if they were super busy and apologized, however they were\/did not. And then after they took our order 60 mins in (we set a timer)  my husband got up to ask, kindly I may add how much longer it would take. The server got defensive with him. I myself have been a server for over 5 years and this is so unacceptable. No apology, she argued us when we were just asking if she could check how many tickets were still ahead of us. Then proceeded to tell us we can cancel our order. Jesus woman, no one even yelled at you. So we just left. I'm so upset about this server, but I don't even want to come back to see her face.

The customer service is not only the worst I have received in Las Vegas, but in all of the hotels I have frequented in my life. \n\nWaiting in line at the front desk was a nightmare. The staff acted like they were doormen at a club, as if I hadn't paid money to stay there. One staff member told me check-in was from 3pm-4pm. When I went to pick up my room key at 4pm, another staff member told me check-in wasn't until 5pm. I was told, \"I know it will make you feel better to know when you are going to get your room, but we just don't guarantee a check-in time. There's just no way of knowing.\" And then she laughed at me and made no eye contact. The hotel is aware they aren't even located on the strip, right? Does the staff know that they aren't the rock stars that are featured in the hotel? \n\nWhen I finally got to check-in, my room had empty beer bottles in the room from the person who had stayed there the night prior. Also, there were dirty towels in the sink. \n\nI will never stay\/gamble there again. It's a crappy hotel with service you would expect to receive at the 99 cent store.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}
